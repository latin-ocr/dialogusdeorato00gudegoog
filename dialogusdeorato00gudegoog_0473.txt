35 non multum aetate antecedens Calvus Vatinium: According
to Quint. XII 6,1 Calvus, who was horn in 82 0. 0., began his
oratorical career some time before he had reached the quaestoriam
age (i. 0. the 27110 year). The present allusion must, therefore, he
understood of the first accusation 01 Vatinius in 58, when Calvus
was 24 years old, which perfectly agrees with the statement ‘non
multum aetate antecedens' (sc. Crassum Caesarem Pollionem).
This indisputable inference, as well as ‘hodieque leyr'mus,'
below, admirably confirma the conjecture that this first speech
against Vatinius, though never actually delivered, was subsequently
put in writing. See note o. 21 10. -With the phrase ‘non multum
