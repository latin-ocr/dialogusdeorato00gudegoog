And this man, it is seriously contended‚ was uot likely, at the
age of 27, to hare had any desire to discuss or the requisite intel-
lectual equipment aud maturity to fathom a problem which must
needs have suggested itself to every educated observor of the liter·
ary characteristica of his time! But, if we must assume that
Tacitus could have had no scruples in calling himself ‘iuvenis
admodum’ with reference to the days of his forensic apprentioe·
ship, inasmuoh as he even styles himself ‘iuvenis' at the beginning
of Domitian's reign‚³⁴ is the phrase itself properly applicabis to a
youth of 21? There is not the slightest doubt of it, for words
designating time of life are of au extremely elastic nature in
Latin.⁸⁵ Finally, eren supposing that the term ‘iuvenis admodum'
were more consistently used in Latin thau it is, and had been
rigidly confined to the 17th or 18th 16111,Μ Tacitus, we coutend‚
would still have had a very strong motivo for· intentionally pre·
seuting himself as younger than he actually was, iu order to
account for the certainly strange circumstance that he, though

⁸¹ Ag. 3 tot annis (1.6. 81-96 Α. a), quibus iuvenes ad senectutem (at the age
of 421) . . . per silentium venimus. Cp. also Ag. u consul filiam iacent mihi
despondit (77 Α. n).

⁸⁶ Thus e. g. Nepos (Att. 8, 2) speaks of Brutus aa ‘adulescens' at the age ο1
37, 01 Hamilcar aad Eumenes as ‘peradulescentes,' when 21 years old. Sallust
(Cat. 3) styles himself ‘adulescens' at the age ο1 34, and Caesar (Cat. 46) at 36
‘adulescentulus' Pompey in his 24111 year was still ί11611111111611611,’1660111113
to Cic. (pro leg. Man. 21). Cicero himself was ‘adulescens' at the age of 26,
when he defended Roscius (Orat. 30, 107), and Geli. XV 28, 5 11 speaking oi
the same trial uses the phrase ‘admodum adulescens' Crassus when 21 years
old is ‘adulescentulam' aud ‘adrnodum adulescens* (Cio. de off. 11 13, 47 Brut.
43, 159). Iu Cic. Phil. V 17, 48 wo read ί61111611011111161111111,ΤΙ Flamininus
admodum adulescentes comulas facti. Veli. Pat. II 41, 3 styles Caesar when 24
‘admodum iuvenis,‘ aud Quint. (11116, l) finally goes so far as to designate
Demosthenes at the age ο121 as ‘admodum puerum’ 1 cp. also Eckstein p. 37
Haase p. 1111111662 Weinkauii p. XXIX. XLIII. CLVII 3111611341.

⁸⁸ Cp. Nipp. Andr. arnt. Anu. p. 7 “ Denn frdhesteus ist diese Bezeichnung
wohl fiir das 1716 Jahr anwendbar, mit welchem die toga virilis angelegt wurde;
wie weit sie aber fiir das spatere Alter ausgedehnt werden konnte‚ wird sich bel
dem Schwenkenden‚ dass alle Altersangaben dieserhrt haben, kaurn bestimmen
lassen.’' lt isvery remarkable that andresen, who so streuuously objects to
the phrase ‘admodum iuvenis‚’ should have allowed the above words to stand,
although he quietly omitted other equally important passages from Nipperdey’s
original introduction. See note 29.
