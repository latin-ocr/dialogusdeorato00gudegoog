Prior. 35, 112 campus inquo exsultare possit emtor, where Reid
cites many other examples.

‘Atticm' isthe evident emendation oi Lipsius for ‘antiquus' es ls clear
from the context, for Aper is repeating some hostile criticisms on Cicero,
among which no such absurd charge as ‘parum antiquus' would imply,
could ever have been made, it is confirmed by Quint xll 10, 12. 14. 10 a,

and by everything that we can uncertain concerning the grem struggle
between Cicero and the Atticists headed by Calvus; the emendation is

finally externally supported by the demonstrable interchange of ‘antiquus’
and ‘Atticus' in other MSS. See the variants quoted p. 22.

21 legistis· - · calvi et Bruti · · · epistulas: None of these letters
have come down to us, and they may have belonged to that class
which, together with their ansvers, Cicero himself did not expect
tc see published. cf. ad fam. XV 21,4 primum ego illas Calvo
litteras misi non plus quam has quas nunc legis existimans exituras.
Aliter enim scribimus quod eos solos quibus mittimus, aliter quod
multos lecturos putamus. But Tire, his literary executor, like a
modern Fronde, did not share these scruples. Quintilian has two
unmistakable references to this very correspondence: IX 4,1 de
compositione non equidem post M. Tullium scribere auderem . ..
nisi et eiusdem aetatis homines scriptis ud ipsum aiam littam
reprehendere id collocandi genus ausi fuissent XII 1, 22 nec Cicero
Bruto Caluoque qui certe compositionem illius etiam apud ipsum
reprehendunt. The remark of Cicer0, quoted by Pinacium,
was in my judgment also taken from the same source: πρός τινα
τῶν ἑταίρων ἔθηκεν ἒν ἐπιστολῇ γράψας ἐνιαχοῦ τῶν λόγων ἀπονυ-
στάζειν τὸν Δημοσθένη (ef. Quint. X 1, 24 XII 1, 22), for ill the Orat.
30, 104, Cicero speaking quite generally only says that D. did not
satisfy his exacting teste.

23 calvum· --ciceroni nsum exsanguem et aridum: cf. Quint.

· l. c. haec manus (sc. Atticorum imitatores) quasi quibusdam sacris

initiata ut alienigenam et parum superstitiosum devinctumque illis
legibus insequebantur, unde nunc quoque aridi et exsucci et

verborum attenuatione commode versari, veniunt ad aridum et

as an essential quality in an orator. Cf. Brut. 9, 36. 82, 283 (in
reference to Calvus) de orat. 1 13, 56. -Other synonyme are cncr-
