logical connecting link between the two propositione: 'Bassus is a
perfect poet’ and ‘no one is a more suitahle eulprit.' Again Se
cundus’ friendship for Bassus and thc latter's poetical renown,
are two premises contained in the rhetorical question ‘quis . . .poe·
tam‚' of which the refusal of Secundus to act as judgo forms the
conclusion.

reum locupletiorem: locuples seems to be a legal terni signifying
‘weighty or trustworthy' (Quint. X 1, 67 XII 10, 78) and is usually

joined with testis, auctor. With reus: Liv. IX 9,18 nos suiuus rei
satis locupletes. Digest. XII 1, 41 reum locupletem offerre. cf.

Anu. IV 43 quod si vatum . . ad testimonia vocentur . . locuple·
tiores esse. Secundus means to say, if poetry is to be accused, then
1 know of no more suitahle culprit, no more weighty representative
of that art than my friend Bassus. So much the more reason for
my declining to sit in judgmeut upon a question in which poetry

is involved. -In Apter’s ‘Defence of Oratory’ which now follows
theauthor has admirably succeeded in individualising the speaker
both in style and sentiment. Iu his fondness for metaphors, ful-
ucss of expression, epigrammatis point, conspicuous throughout
this speech, Aper stands out in bold relief as a true representative
of the rhetorical eloquenco of his time. That this effect is brought
about notwithstanding the fact that the author has repeatedly
appropriated Ciceroniau ‘motives’ :rud phrases proves, on the one
haud, that Aper's defenoc is not strictly historioal, and 011 the
other that Tacitus even in his youth was no servile imitator bnt an
artist who breathed a new originality even into horrowed material.
