IN COLLEGE SERIES OF LA ΤΙΝ AUTHORS.

Owing to the laclr ol an annotated English edition, the Dihlogus ot Tacitus
has hitherto been practically inaccessible to the students ol American 3ηά English
colleges. In foreign schools the work has long been highly prized, and it is well
worthy ol 3 place ln our own higher education.

Great pains have been taken in this edition to incorporate the results ol the
most recent textual 3ηά exegetIcal studies on the Dialogus, SpecIal attention has
been paid to the language in its relations to prae-Augustan standards on theone
hand and to Tacitus’s later works on the other. An Introduction treats oi the
disputed authorship οἱ the work, ol the interlocutum, the language and style, the
date ot composition, and the course ol thought. A critical appendix and indexes

accompany the volume.
