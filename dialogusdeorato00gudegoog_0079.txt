Otho c. 9.¹⁴⁴ That he died at an early age, perhaps about the same
time as Aper, is clear from Quintilian and c. etot the Tacitean
treatise.¹⁴⁵

The internal' agreement between Tacitus and Quintilian, in the
high estimato of the oratorical abilities oi Secundae, is remarkable
and seems to prove that his picture, as drawn by the former, is
a tolerably faithful likeness. He is coupled with Aper as among
the ‘celeberrima ingenia iori’3 his cautious disposition and non·
combative nature, alluded to by Quintilian, is revealed in the very
first words put into his mouth by Tacitus (c. 2 4 ff. nihilne te . . .
fabulae malignorum terreat. . ,sublatis si qna pravae interpretur
tioni materiam dederunt, emitteres Catonem . . . severiorem) and
Quintilian’s statement regarding his overscrupulous care finds an
echo in the phrase in c. 399 caram et diligentis criti nimietatem
contrariam experimur.¹‘⁶ This characteristic seems to have occa·
sioned the charge that he lacked readiness and fluency oi speech,¹⁴'
a criticism which his devoted pupil does not really refute, when he

much too late, ior apart trom the fact that Secundus would still have been
living when the Dialogus was publishcd, wc should be involved in another
difficulty. For it is not likely that Tacitus carne under the instruction oi
Quintilian betore the death oi Secundus. Now, Tacitus must have completed
his studies before Agricola betrothed his daughter to him (77 a. n). But ii sc,
what is more natural than to suppose that the young Tacitus, Secundus having
died shortly aiter 75 i. ra, became ior a short time the pupil oi Quintilian, who
had lived on terras ot the closest intimacy with his departcd teacher? Both must
have been previously acquainted, aad it is pleasant to think, albeit a mere
fancy, that Quintilian may have been an occasional participant in the ‘disputa-
tiones et arcana semotae dictionis,' which Tacitus so often had the privilege oi
listening to in the house of Secundus (domi quoquc. . . adsectabar). At all
events, we may say that the assumption oi any later date ior the death ot
Secundus than thc one here. alvocated. would at thc same time necessitate the
rejection oi the all but certain hypothesis that the future historiari had come
under the direct influence oi the great rhetorician.

¹⁴⁶ lt is no exaggeration to say that this statement is as eminently character·
istic oi Secundus, as it is absolutely out of place in the mouth ol the poet
Maternus.
