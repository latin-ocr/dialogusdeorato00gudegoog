PROLEGOMENA. XV

critics felt themselves on safer ground, if they attributed the
work to a well-known author rather than to some intangible
unknown individual. Among the better known scholars who
espoused this view, may be mentioned Gruter, Gronovius, Graevius,
Densa, Freinsheim‚ Fabricius, Pichena and above all C. A. Heumann, Heumana
in his edition of the Dialogus published exactly two hundred years
after Rhenanus. Their arguments were chiefly based upon the
stylistio similarity between the Dialogus and the Institutio Oratoria.
The insuperable chronological difficulties in the way of this hypoth-
esis, though hinted at by Lipsius and strongly emphasised by
Dodwell, were either studiously ignored or curtly dismissed as ,
irrelevant. It remained for Spaldiap, in a long note to Quint. VI spatulas.

blow to the view held so obstinately and so long, although R.
Novak has quite recently again made elaborious attempt to resus-
citate the Quintilian theory, ‘non melius,' to use Aper's words,
‘quam [alii] sed felicius quia illum fecisse panciores sciunt'

Lipsius' noa liquere, however, opened wide the door for other
conjectures regarding the real author, for the orthodox view had
still but lew supporters, the idea that the stylistio problem was
capable of a solution being as yet entertained by no one. In 1778,
Ι. I. H. Nost published a German translation ci the Dialogus, in Nost.
which, for the first time, the younger Pliny enters the list oi com-
petitors for the authorship of the treatise. The arguments of Nast
were based on the same grounds which had prompted so many
previous scholars to declare in lavor of Quintilian-alleged rc-
markable parallelisrns in thought and diction, the biographical data
of Pliny being violently twisted into conformity with the evidence,
historical and literary, iurnished by the Dialogus. Nast's hypoth-
esis was subsequently championed by Wittich, Kramarczik and
especially elaborated by Fr. Hess. Το say that this view has bcen Πρω.
finally disposed ol by Eokstein, Gutmann and Vogel is perhaps
hazardous, for Pliny rnay still find some belated supportcr as did
Quintilian! It may, however, be remarked, that il we are forced
to assign any argumentative validity whatever to the numerous
stylistio parallelisms adduced in favor of Pliny and oi Quintilian,
only one of two inferences will be possible: Either Pliny aad

may have been inserted, on the authority oi Lipsius, by lohannes Sambucns
pasl-1584), to whom this MS. is known to have belonged.
