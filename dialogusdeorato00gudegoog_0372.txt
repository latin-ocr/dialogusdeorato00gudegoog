Hor. Ep. 112, 11611. Seu. Ep. 58‚5 quantum apud Ennium et ,
Accium verborum situs occupaverit 115,7 and so πῖνος 111 Greek
e. g. περὶ dp. 30. The sense of the passage is therefore clearly this:
Poetic ornament is no less essentia] to the modern orator than 10
the poet, but it must not resemble the diction of old Pacuvius and
Accius, incrusted as it is with au arohaic mould which has tainted
whatever poetic embellishment it may have originally possessed.

2001 Horatii ct Vergilii ct Lucani: The mention of Horace
seems somewhat out of place in this connection, and Ovid, some of
whose poems are little more than versilied suasoriae (cf. Sen.
Contr. 11 10), would perhaps have been a more suitable selection.
Virgil's great influence upon later rhetoricians is attested by what
Seu. Suae. 1115 says of Arellius Fuscus: Vergilii versus voluit
imitari. . ., solebat. . . ex Vergilio multa trahere sqq. —Opinions

III p. 9111, The marked preference for these modern writers soon
caused a reaction iu favor of the older poets which reached its
height in Fronto and his school. Cp. Friedl. l. c. p. 380-384 and
note c. 23 7.—horum i. e. the class of hearers mentioned above

21 auribus ct iudiciis, is best not taken as a hendiadyS, ‘auribus‚’
referring more particularly to ‘sensus' etc, and ‘iudiciis' to
¹locus,' etc.

2110111 pulchrior ct ornatior extitit etc: Among the proso
