With the possible exception oi Caes. B. G. VI 30 aedilicio circumdato

Taking this in connection with the remarkable parallel passage imm Quint
just cited, 1 have had no hesitation in inserting ‘omnia’ The archetypon

had cu, which either stood ior ‘omnia' as in c. 2 14 13 tc or was possibly a

remnant oi an original ‘cuncta’ but as the compendium was not under·

stood by the scribe, the syllable was dropped. So similarly in Quint xl,
106 omnia, though essential to the context, is omitted in some MSS.
Perhaps the passage in Caesar is only another case in point

3 quinque in Verrem libros expectabit: Aper sophistically ignores
the factthat Cicero actually delivered only one speech in court
against Verres (Aug. 5, 7 0 a. e), the others having been, as is well
known, subsequently composed.

There are in ali aie speeches against Verres, but Aper, according to our
MSS, mentions only live, excluding, as isexpresst or tacitly assumed by
the commentatore, the Actio Prima. But iu doing so, Aper would be vlrbr·
ally confessing that he was weil aware oi the purely literam character oi the
other live, which cannot possibly have been his intention, ior ir his censure
was to have any foundation at all, it was clearly essentia] to speak oi all the
aia extant orations as having been arunde delivered, and this I believe he
did. The archetypon had either VIINVERREM or vunverrem, which
readIng, owing to the graphical identity oi the numeral and the letter ‘l'
following, caused the evident corruption now existing.

expectabit: i. e. ‘wait or listen patiently to the end' cf. Cic.
