the chapter, makes it highly probable that the first named sum here
6166 pertains to the first mentioned individual. The wealthiest
Romans, 66 far as known to us, were the augur Cn. Lentulus
(under Augustus) and Narcissus (under Nero), who are said to
have been worth 400,000,000 sesterces (about 617600600)Ι Op.

6 quamquam: The subj. with ‘quamquam’ is not found in prose
before Nepos, for, wherever the subj. is still retained in modern texts
of Cicero, it is either potential or used in a dependent clause. Once
inVerg. Aen. VI 394. Frequent in Horace and Livy. Cp. Dr.H. S.

indicative being used but twenty times (out of eighty instances)

7 beneflcio: *by reason of, on account of! Beneficio is here well
on its way toward its later use as a synonym of gratia or causa. lt is
perhaps first met with in the soealled Hygin. Astron. II 231)

174 f. 574, Bursian Jatrester. XLIV p. 198. The ‘quamquam'
clause has occasioned unnecessary difficulty. Although, says Aper,
Marcellus and Crispus may be thought (videri) 66 have come into
the possessiones vast riches by virtue of their oratorical power, yet
their world-wide fame was not due to their wealth, but solely 66
their eloquence. Thus the speaker, by taking unexpectedly a
purely ideal view, might seem to be contradicting or 66 least
weakening the utilitarian arguments which he had 66 earnestly
advanced in a previous chapter. To eounteract this, Aper, shrewd
advocate that he is, abandons for a moment the strict sequence of
topice outlined in the beginning of his speech and reverts to the
question of the utility of eloqueuce once more, although he had
assured us ‘plura de utilitate non dico' 16 this, one cannot but
admire the art of the author who, while depicting the trained

· rhetorician, yet succeeds in preserving some of the stylistic aban-

don characteristic of a conversation between friends. -sed elo·

quentia: Sed was perhaps unnecessarily inserted by Lipsius, for
the adversative particle is very often omitted by Tacitus. See note
