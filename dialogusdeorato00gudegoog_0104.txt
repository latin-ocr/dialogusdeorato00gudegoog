raonnsounna xcvii

in the note to c. et Β, was undoubtedly a kind of oratorioal anthol-
ogy. lf so, it is in the highest degree probable that some other
similar details concerning the orators of the Republic, especially in
those instances in which the Brutus of Cicero could not have been
Tacitus' source, were culled from Mucianus’ bandy collection.

To this ‘Quelle’ I am disposed to assign the interesting passage
in which we are told that the great orators oi the Republic de
livered uo speeches before the centumviral court, Pollio's celebrated
speeches for the heirs oi Urbinia constituting only an apparent
exception. See note to c. 37 14.

The other passage which, in my judgment, was taken from the
‘Acta’ is the close of c. 34, which gives the age at which Crassus,
Caesar, Asinius Pollio and Calvus made their oratorioal debut, and
the names oi the men whom they prosecuted on that occasion.
For it will not be denied that it is intrinsically improbable to
suppose that Tacitus laboriously collected each single item from
independens aud necessarily widely scattered sources, a hypothesis
rendered the more precarious, when it is remembered that our

passage contains two palpable chronological errors, and that ,one of
these data (concerniug Crassus) is given comectly by Cicero in the

de oratore,¹¹³⁸ with which dialogue our author, as we have seen, was
very familiar. The detailed information bears all the marks of
having been due to some compendium or annalistic record of
literary history. Several works oi this kind are known to us.
But the Chronico of Nepos were unavailable, because they were
published before 63 ao, and could not, therefore, have included
Pollio’s speech against C. Cato; the Annales oi Atticus are also
excluded, because they constituted Cicero's source in the de oratore.
The Anticles of Fenestella recorded the dates of the speeches of
ἡ celebrated oratore, their chronology having already in his day
become confused, as we may infer from a well-known passage in
Gellius.1⁹⁴ Tacitus may, therefore, have been indebted to this
