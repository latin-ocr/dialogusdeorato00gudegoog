In support of this, Scholl seems to lay great stress upon the word
‘importasses‚' taking it in its usual sense of ‘importing from a
foreign locality,' but in that case ‘novum’ were quite out oi place,
for the 'importation of Greek fabulae' is as oldas the Roman
drama itself. Scholl’s interpretation of nonum, ‘subjects treated
for the first time as opposed to the hackneyed Greek fable’ is also
at varianae with the facts and involves a petitio principii. Aper
is uncompromisingly opposed to oll poetic productioris 01 Mater·
nus, as is unmisrakably indicated by 0. 591. Securus sit. . .
Saleius Bassus et quisquis alius studium poeticae et carminum
gloriam fovet curn cousus oycre noo possit. Vahlen also observes
that we should rather expect ‘eece Catonem' in place of ‘Medeam’
which play had not yet been mentioned, but this objection applies
with eqnal force to the Domitius. The author simply desired to
acquaint the reader with the titles of all of the dramas of Maternus
and the antithesis iu the last clause naturally suggested the syrn-
metrical grouping of the Greek and the Roman titles. For other,

more or less genuine instances ol inconsisteney, see Vahlen l. c. >

accessory uotion of something troublesome or disagreeable (so here

—importasses=imponere, iniungere. This verb in its figurative
, sense is invariably used 01 disagreeable things, and 11 is in this
light that Aper regards the occupation to which Maternus proposes
to devote himself. Cp. Hor. Ep. 1 13, 5 odium libellis importes
