writers e. g. Plin. Pan. 95,1 Florus III 19, 11 circa apprehenden-
‚ dum eum multitudo contendit3 with gerund, once in Quint. IV 5,
6 plus eloquentia circa (=ad) movendum valet-Observa also
that a substantIve with gerundive, when governed by a preposition,

, serves as an idiomatic substitute for an abstract noun. In Tacitus

the construction is quite common with ‘ad'3 cuce with ‘ob': Ann.
XI 5 ; with ‘circa' only here. - educendos formandosque ‘bringing
up and nearing of children! ‘Educare' of physical training seems
to occur in but one other passage viz. Varro, de liberis educandis,
cited by Nonius s. v. ‘educit obstetrix, 010001 nutris, instituit
paedagogus, docet magister. The nearest approach to this usage
elsewhere is perhaps 10 be found in Cic. Orat. 13, 42 where see
Sandys and Brut. 58, 211 cited below. On the significauce of this
parallelism, sce Prolegomena p. cii. ‘formare’ with a persoual
object is poetic, but frequent iu posthugustan prose. See the cxx.
cited by Kleiber p. 60.

13 pridem ‘formerly' So Cic. ad farn. V 6, 2 quod ad me pridem
scripseras. Especially common in Iustinus e. g. VI, 12 XII 6, 7
XXXI 3, 10, but iu Tac. only here—suus cuique fillus: Peter
interprete this phrase to mean that the boy was educated at home
and 001 in company with other children. But Tacitus is here
clearly speaking 01 infanoy, as shown by ‘cellula...nut1·icis'
and Quintilian (I 2, 1) 100 does not discuss the question ‘utilius
domi an in scholis erudiatur' until ‘iam paulatim accrescere puer
ct exire de premio et discere serio incipiat!

14 emptae nutricis ‘hired wetnurse,' τίτθη. On this meaning
01 the word, see Wilkins, Cic. de orat. II 39,162. On the fonction
of the nurse in the household 01 the encients, cp. 1. H. Krause,
Gesch. der Erzielruny . . . bei den Gricclr. 0. Rem. p. eol-398.-
iu gremio ae siun matris: The pararnount importance here attached
to the mother's own nursing finds a very significant echo in later
utterances of Tacitus cf. Ag. 4 mater luha Procilla fuit, rarae
cust-itatis: in huius sinu indulgentiaque educatus and especially G.

The same is recorded of Cato's wife by Plut. Cat. Mai. 20, 5.
