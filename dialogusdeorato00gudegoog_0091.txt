ancients is, in perfect kecping with the cautious nature of the man,
brought out in a negative way by his contention that the moderna
did not enjoy the essential conditione which made the cratory of
the past what it was. The prerequisite clement of a direct and
irreconcilable antagonism between the two eminent toachers cf
Tacitus is therefore wholly and significantly wanting, aud hence
there existed no motive for including Secundus in the ‘criminatim'
with which Maternus and Messalla on the onc side, and Aper, their
equally fervent opponent, on the other, good-naturedly threaten
one another in parting.

Summing up the previous discussion, we conclude that, aiter
Messalla· bad finished, Secundam followed in a speech, and that he
in turn was succeeded by Maternus, who brings the entire debatc
to a close. But the beginning and end of Secundus’ speech, the
end of Messalla's, and the beginning of that of Maternus are lost
in the two lacunae (c. 35 ext. 40 7) which unfortunately disfigure
the closing porticus of the treatise.

There remains the vexed question as to the probable extent and
contents of the lacuna after c. 35, the text breaking off and begin·
ning in the middle cf a sentence.

Of our MSS, only the X class (A and B) seem at first sight to
iurnish a definite clue to the exact size of the gap, both stating

that sic puycs were missing. But unfortunately the Dialogus takes
up 16 pagos in A and 29 in B, which proves that the words ‘sex
pagellae' were simply copied from their common source,¹⁰⁹ now lost,
so that we are still ignorant as to the actual dimensione of the
page in the original archetypcn. Eggerm maintained that nine
pages had been omitted, basing his calculation upon the worthless
cod. Parisiensis 7ῖ73, but his premise is a pure fancy, and has justly
been rejected by Habbe ¹⁷¹ (p. 8). His own attempt, however,
though ingenious, rests upon no firmet foundation, as he operates
with two undemonstrablc assumptione. He tacitly takes it for

granted: (1) That the number sir was found in the margin of the
cod. Hersfeldensis (2) Tliat the codd. Med. 47, 36 and 68,1, con·
taining respectivcly the letters of Pliny and Tac. Ann. V (V I), and
written by the same hand, were copied from a codex miscellaneus,
comprising also the Dialogus, the Germania and the Suetonian
