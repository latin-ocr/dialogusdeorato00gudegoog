his libellons attacks, he was banished to the desert island of
Seriphos by Tiberius, where he died in most abject poverty in
32 aa. cf. Taahnn. 1 72 IV 21. The frequent allusione to him
in Seneca Rhetor, Tacitus, and Quintilian bear ample testimony
to the enduring impression which his eloquente made, and justify,
in a partial measure, the great importante which Aper and even
Messalla (c. 26, where see notes) attach to him. (lp. Teuffel, ς 267,
11 aud esp. P. Robert, De Cassii &oeci eloquentia, Paris 1890,
pp. 83. Cassius Severus occupies the same position in the devel-

opment oi Roman eloquenoe that Demetrius Phalereus does among
the Greeks. Cp. note e. 14 14.

The opening paragraph oi this chapter is beset with very great difficulties,
owing to a corruption and lacuna in the text, which scholare have with
but indifferent success attempted to solve (see p. 23). The insertion of
‘Sevemm' after Cassium is an evident emendation, for the orator is every·
where cited with his full name, with but three exceptions in Quint (VI
l, 48 X l, 22 XII, 10, ll), where the context, however, precludes the
pomihility oi a misunderstanding. ‘Qui usque’ points unmistakably to a
lacuna. Vahlen's and John's restorations give, it must be admitted, every
satisfactory sense, and at the same tlme account for the origin of the cor-
ruption, hut the emendation oi the former, as John points out, involves the
necessity oi referring ‘qui' to the distant antecedent ‘admiratores,'-in my
iudgment a fatal objectiou. To obviate this difficulty, lt has been suggested
to take ‘huno' as the personal pronoun referring to Cassius Sevems, hut
this seems improbable, because the relative ‘qui' clause would in that cese
be out of place. John, therefore, substitutes ‘ut’ for ‘qui' which is too
bold a change. The possibility of a proper interpretation of ‘reum faciunt*
whloh bears all the marks of genuineness, appears to have been lost with
the missing words in the lacuna. Michaelis, followed by Peter, Wolll and
Andresen, takes ‘quatenus. . . solent’ as a parenthesis, and omits ‘qul
usque ad’ and ‘quem reum faciunt,' an emendation withouta shadow 'of
intrinsic probability. The difficulties seem to me to he insuperable, without
the accession of new MS. material. Cp. on the whole question Vahlen,
Protea Berl. 1878-9, p. 13 f., and the detailed discussion of John, Gor·
