the reign of Titus. Happily it can also be proved (1) that it mast
· have been composed at that time and (2) that a later date, while
quite incompatible with Tacitean authorship, is at the same time
irreconcilable with the authorship of any one else, so that we are
put to the alternative ol attributing the Dialogue to the writer to
whom the MSS. ascribe it (the biographical data ol Tacitus inter·

posing no obstacle to this assumption), or ol unwarrantably suppos-
ing that some totally unknown author wrote the treatise between ,
79-811 '

In the first place,I lully agree with Andresen and others that Written in
the view which brings the Dialogus within close temporal proximity ‘mm ⁰s
to the Agricola and Germania involves a psychological impossibility
(see also note 28).

A second obstacle in the way of a later date was first pointed out,
1 believe, by Steiner(p.1i'l.). In the introductory chapter, the
author tells us that he intends to reproduee from memory ‘isdem
numeris isdemque rationibuS, servato ordine disputationis,' a dehate
which he had heard as a very young man. Now on the theory that
these words were written six or seven years after the event
referred te, the statement, though taxing our credulity to some
extent, nevertheless remains within the bounds of possibility. At
any rate, it does not go beyond the wide latitude which the
traditional usage of dialogue writers from Plato to Cicero has
sanctioned. In fact, the prooemium ol the Dialogus is unmistak·
ably rnodelled upon a similar dramatic device ol Cicero.³⁹ Plat0, it
is true, makes most extraordinary demands upon the memory of his
Socrates, but he is very careful to confine the interval between the
discussion and its subsequent detailed report to very narrow limita.
In view oi these factS, it may be safely denied that a writer, who
shows himself so admirahly successful in imparting to a fictitious
debate the semblance ol historica] reality, would deliberately, at the
very outset, disillusionise his readers hy eahnly asserting that he
was simply retelling lrom memory, with all aeeuraey and minute-
ness of detail, a conversation which he had listened to more than
—hoenty years previous! Such seli-stirltilication on the part oi
our author is incredible, and yet we should he forced to believe
in it, if our treatise was not written till alter the death ol
Domitian.
