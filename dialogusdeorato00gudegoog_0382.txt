quam Cicero: Cicero was a prolific and versatile poet (Plut. cic.
40) and many titles, together with very considerable fragments,
which, with the exception of the Aratea, are chiefly preserved in
his own works, have come down to us. (See Teuffel i 17 7 a 1. 189,
1-4). Plut. Cic. 2, on the authority oi some post-Aug. writer, very
probably Suetonius (see Trans. rimer. Ptilol. Ass. vol. XX p. 148-
150) says llpowbv bi τῷ χρόνῳ καὶ ποικιλώτκρον ἁπτόμενος τῆς περὶ

disparaging criticisms principally found in writers of the 1. cent.
