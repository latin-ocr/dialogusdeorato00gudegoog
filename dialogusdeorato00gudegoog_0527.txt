209. It is, therefore, not necessary to assume that the Dial. pas·
sage is a reminiscence from Horace. See below.

1 cannot agree with Baehrens (Comen. Crit. p. 98) and John ad loc. that
the clauses 'v0s. . . esseut' and ‘deus. . . mutasset' express an alterna·
tive, for this would not only require ‘et’ ior the second “aut,' and 'aut' ior
the first ‘aa' but also the deletion oi ‘tempora' John, moreover, himself
admits that the first no less Man the second miracle could only be realised
by divine intervention. The second clause is, in my judgmeut, simply a
varied reiteration oi the preceding, as in c. 384 nemo intra paucissimas
perorare horas aud modum in dicendo sibi quisque sumebat. The deletion
oi the entire clause ‘deus . . . mutasset’ seems to me equally unjustifrable,
ior, though the Horatian parallel might have been recalled by some ancient
render, itis not sufficiently similar to have suggested a marginal gloss or
interpolation iu the iorm in which we find it iu our passage. —oestra as its
position shows, isquite out oi place. It was originally written above the
line, being subsequently introduced into the text.

23 modus et temperamentum: cf. Secundus' words in c. 387
veluti frenos eto. c. 397 est aliquis oratorum campus etc. and
1. 23 frigidissimos quoque oratores ipsa certantis populi studia
excitare et inscendere potuerint. ’

25 bono saeculi sni quisque citra obtrectationem alterius utatur:
It is inconceivable that Tacitus put this advice into the mouth oi
Maternus, ii the same speaker had delivered the eulogy on the
superior character of the oratory of the Republio, contained in
c. 36 ff. With the thought, cf. Tac. Η. 13 non tamen adeo virtu-
tum sterile saeculum, ut non et bona exempla prodiderit, and Anu.
111 55 (cited c. 15 2).—citro = sine, cl. c. 27 10.-quisquc is the
antithesis oi ‘nemo' preceding, 'utrique' would, therefore, have
been out of place, even if we take ‘alterius’ in a strictly definite
seuse3 'saeculum’ as in c. 11 is synonymous with ‘aetas' and
‘tempora'

42. 1 cum Messalla: ‘inquit' is omitted as in c. 41 251 281.
—qnibus contradicerem: Messalla the uncompromising ‘laudator
temporis acti' was not likely to acquiesce in the opportunistic
doctrine advocated by Maternus in c. 41. It is to this chapter
that ‘si qua obscura' alludes.

2 dies esset exactus: 'exigere' in these and similar phrases for
‘conficere' is poetic aud postAug. In Tac: H. Ι 78 exacto per
scelera die Amr. III 16 diem supremum noctemque exegisset Ag.
3 exactae aetatis terminos 38 exacta iam aestate H. IV 84 tri·
ennio exacto. With ‘consumere' H. IV 43 c. per discordiam dies.
