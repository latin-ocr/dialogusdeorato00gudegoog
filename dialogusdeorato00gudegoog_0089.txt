oratorical achievement which pervades every line of c. 36-408
(cp. esp. 37 11 ft), is quite out of place in the mouth ol Maternus,
because he expressly restrains Messalla from indulging in a similar
strain, regarding any panegyric of the eloquence of the republican
period as superfluous. Op. c. 2411 exprome nobis non laudationem
antiquorum, satis enim illos fama sua laudat 27 2 neque hoc colligi
desideramus, disertiores esse antiquos, quod apud me quidem in
confesso est.

Again in c. 36 23 ff. 34 f. the irrclispeneabr'lity ol eloquence is
strongly maintained, but Maternus cannot well have shared this
opinion, for otherwise he would hardly have bidden farewell to the
forum. Maternus accepts the reason for the decline of eloquence
as given by the previous speaker, but with this cardinal differenec.
The one contende that a sturdy eloquence, however desirable, if
possible only under anarchieal conditions, is no compensation for
a peaceful oommonwealth with a corresponding oratorical retro-
gression3 the other leaves us to infer that he would rejoice in
a superior oratorical development at any eost, though he prizes the
blessings of peace no less highly than his friend. Maternus, as
behooves the poet, in Aristotle's opinion, takes a philosophioal
view ; he deals more or less with general truths. The attitude of
the speaker of c. 36-40 8, on the other hand, is that of the historica
who searches into the causes that underlie historical phenomena,
and who illustratos his argument by concrete illustratione aud
learned detail. Cp. e. g. the reference to Mucianus, the date of
one of Pollio's speecheS, the enumeration ol Cicero's orations, the
allusion to an enactment in one of Pompey's laws, the discussion
concerning the procedure in the law courts, the attire of advocates,
and many minor items. ‘Eiidem ratio in nostra quoque civitate’
proves conclusively that the sorno speaker gave the sciere reason for
the decline of Greek oratory as for the Roman. But this exposition
is again unsuited to the poet Maternus.

It furnishes the true solution, moreover, of the singular coin·
cidence which Messalla had told his hearers often puzzled him
(c. 1513 quod quibusdam solacio est, mihi auget quaestionem
etc). The passages dealing so successfully with this perplexing
problem cannot therefore have been spoken by Messalla. The

same inference must be drawn from amore external observation.
Messalla's share in the debate takes up about three tenths of the
