cos. 40, triumphed over the Parthians 39, died o. 5 1. 11.), Μ. Valet-ica
Messalla Carrinas (born (164 11. c. cos. 31, triumphed over the Gauls
27, died not later than 81111), both distinguished as statesmen,
generals, poets‚ historiens, and orators, and repeatedly grouped
together e. g. by Quint. X 1, 113 (where see Peterson’s notes), by
Tacitus, c. 17. 21 Anu. IV 34 XI 6. ’1. They are here introduced
only in their capacity as orators, their other literary achievements
being overlooked chiefly because they arc contrasted with Lysias and
Hyperides, partly also because their farne as historiens and poets‚
particularly in Messalla’s case, was, in the judgment of later genera
tions, eclipsed by their oratorical reputation. Liber=orati0 edita
Frequent in Silver Latin, but not in Quintilian. See note c. 3 a.
