V.-THE mmmmm

The ext-ant MSS. of the Dialogus, all 01 the 15th century, are
derived from the copy ²⁰⁵ 01 0 MS. of unknown date, discovered in
some German monastery and brought to Italy about the year
1457s8.²⁰⁰

That this apographon belonged to the Vatican library, as is
generally assumed, is, in my judgment, more than doubtful, 101
the fact that Calixtus III and Pius ΙΙ were 110 patrous 01 learning,
cannot possibly account, as Michaelis strangely imagines, forits
early disappearance from the library, not 1ο mention that the great
humanist Pope, Nicolaus V, was 110 longer living (†1455) when the
unknown works of Tacitae, so long expected by him and Poggio,

’ finally reached Italy. The precious MS, in all probability, passed

into private hands or, like the cod. Mediceus discovered by Boc·
caceio at Monte Cassino, into some cloister's library, where it was

⁹³⁶ That 11 was not the original MS.‚ has becn shown by Reifferscheid pp.
1101. The provcnance 01 this MS. is hrvolved in obscurity. Reifferscheid
argued in 1010101 the monastery 01 Fadia, which is known to have possessed
the works 01 Tacitus, 101110001101 os Fuldo (t 800) and his successor, 1100101010,
incorporated 11110 111011 joint work, the Translatio S. Alexandri, whole chapters
011110 (101111101010. 4. 0. 10, 11. See hlassmann p. 100). In his Addeado p
xiv, Reifferscheid preferred Certen, 110111 which cloister he believed Rudoiius
horrowed his copy 01 Tacitus. Others, 011 more plausible grounds, 11101 the
monastery 01 Hersseld, 101 111 l’oggio's correspondence (01. Michaelis pp. xix-
xxii) touching the discovery 01 hitherto unknown works 01 Tacitus, a ‘monachus
ilcrsieldensis‘ plays a very prominent part.

²⁰⁰1 have no hesitation in rejecting, with Voigt, Wiedcrbeletaag des duaa.
Atratinus 12 pp. 2111 f. note 4, the universally accepted tradition which attrib-
utes the discovery 01 the Dialogus, the Germania and the Suetonius fragment to
Henoch of Ascoli. It rests solcly upon a statement 01 Iovianus Pontanus
(quoted below) which, aa Voigt has convincingly shown. is open to very grave
objections. Poggio, moreover, 110101 mentions Henoch in connection with the
new Tacitean treatiscs, and the well-inforrncd Vespasiano. in his biographicsl
skctch 01 Henoch, expressly says that this monh 11101111 nothing 01 particular

mentary 10 Horace (sce i'oigt 11 p. ‘203 note 1). (ln 1110 probable origin 01
Pontanus' error, see note 213.
