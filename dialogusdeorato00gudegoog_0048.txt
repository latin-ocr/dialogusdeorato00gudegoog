One 01 the most characteristic features 01 the historical works 01
Tacitus is his almost pathetic longing for the irrevocable days 01
old. Amid the moral degeneracy which he saw about him, he
fondly conjures up a primitive golden age 01 justice and innocence,
and in the Germania pictures, 101 the heuefit 01 his contemporaries,
a sturdy racc not yet contaminated hythe vices 01 civilised Rome.⁶⁴
The terms ‘priscus antiquus, vetus’ are everywhere laudatory
epithets. Still he does not give way to despair, but recognises that
his own age is not altogether incapable 01 noble achievement, and
that the halo which envelops the past is apt to blind us to the
good qualities 01 which no period is wholly destitute.

These views coincide in all particulars with the sentiments in
the Dialogus. Messalla deplores the indifference 01 his contem-
poraries for the ‘mores antiqui'38³ the golden age cf pristine purity
is pictured in glowing colors hy the poet Maternus ;18 antiquus,
vetus and priscus are invested throughout with the same signifi-
canee as in the historica] works and the habit 01 idealising the past
at the expense 01 the present is repeatedly alluded to.⁶²
