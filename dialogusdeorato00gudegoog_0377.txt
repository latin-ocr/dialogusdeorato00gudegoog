who was indicted for the murder of an Egyptian ambassador and
successfully defended by Cicero, see ad Att. IV 15, 8. 16,5 ad

Aug, but also found in Cicero e. g. de opt. gen. 5, 13 laborem
utilem studiosis. cp. Antio. II p. 554 f.

10 in Vatinium: P. Vatinios, one of the most prominent figures
in the last days of the Republio, a man of unscrupulous character,
and the servile partisan of Caesar in 011 his ambitious projecta.
Cicero attached him in a speech full 01 virulent invective which has
corne down 10 us. Calvus' speeches against him, at least three in
number (as shown by ‘secunda’), are generally assigned to the
years 58, 56, 54, 1. c. The exact chronology is, however, a matter
of controversy. The first trial was never held, being broken up
hy an armed force, and from certain passages in CIcero's letters it
has been argued that there were two trials in 54, 11 which case
the speech referred to here would be the first 01 that year, and not
that 01 the year 56. See Peter's note. It is, however, equally
possible that Calvus subsequently wrote out the speech which he
had been prevented from delivering, just as Cicero did in the case
of Verres. cf. also 10100. 3435.-Ο1 Vatinius in 3010101111-

These oratorical masterpieces 01 Calvus 010 frequently quoted by
Quintilian, grammarians and rhetoricians, and his sensaticnal elo-
quence on one occasion (cf. Sen. 0011117114, 8) has been immor·
taIIsed in a well-known poem of Catullus (C. LIII, where see
Ellis' oommentary). Cp. also Sandys' Orat. p. XLVI.

11 verbisornata et sententiis: Both the style and substance of
the speech i. e. the thoughts as well as the language in which they
are presented satisfy the requirements of the modern type of ora·
tory. With the phrase itself, cf. Cic. de orat. Ι 49, 213 01 verbis
