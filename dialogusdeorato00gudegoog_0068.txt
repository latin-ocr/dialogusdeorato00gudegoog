in the Dialogus, but could not, from their very nature, have ever
occurred in it, as they deal with the faults of ‘³ elocutio '' proper,
such as the κακόζηλον, hyperbole and the like.m But if so, we are
put upon the horns of a dilemma, ol which it would be hard to say
which is the more absurd. For either Quintilian wrote a book ‘de
causis corruptae eloquentiae' arrd the Dialogus de oratoribus, but
by some strange accident repeatedly referred to the former only, or
else the two are demant, the author's citations being by an equally
strange accident absent from the extant treatise ¹²¹— which had no
place lor them anywherel Ι

The remaining arguments adduced iu favor of Quintilian pertain
to the matter and the focan of the Dialogue, the treatise revealing,
it is contended, so many elements in common with the Institutio
Oratoria as to establish identity of authorship beyond question.

Now as regards the contents of the two works, there can be no
possible doubt, as we may at once admit, that many and ewen
striking points oi resemblance exist, and they have been duly noted
in the Commentary,¹²² but this fact can in no sense justify the
inferente that has been drawn, lor the following reasons:

(1) Similarity of subject matter necessarily leads to similarity in
its presentation.

(2) Very many of the coincidences collected by the writers
mentioned are not peculiar to Quintilian, but may be readily paral-
leled from 'other authors, notably Cicera, to whom both Quintilian
and Tacitus are alike largely indebted. This is equally true of the
numerous aesthetic criticisms of literary men, upon which undue
stress has been laid, for here, if anywhere, the great rhetorician is
almost wholly dependent upon earlier sources, not only in Greek,
but to some extent even in Latin literature, where we certainly
might have expected greater independence and originality.¹²⁸ These
judgments had in course of time become stereotyped ansi common

property, so to speak.
