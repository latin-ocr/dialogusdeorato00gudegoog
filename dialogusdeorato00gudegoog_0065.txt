(3) Tbat this date, examined in the light of the ascertainable
facts of the life of Tacitus, is free from all chronological or internal
objections, and therefore no obstacle to the assumption that the
Dialogus was written bytho author to whom the MSS. assign it.

(4) That the Dialogus and the admittedly genuine writings of
Tacitus reveal an attitude of mind and beart in the judgments and
criticisms passed upon men and messuras so remarkably similar, as
to be explicable only on the suppositiou of identity of authorship.

(5) That by the side of palpable stylistic divergenoies, there
exist equally palpable coincidences.

(6) That these differences in no sense militate against the genu-
ineness of the Dialogue, being dernoustrably the necessary result of
certain natural and well ascertaiuable causes which combined to
shape as well as to change or even to destroy many stylistic
features characteristic of the earliest publication of the future
historian.

Under these circumstances, we might he free to dispenso with a
discussion of the rival claims of Qururmmw or of Pulrrr run
Youncnrr to the authorship of the Dialogue. But inasmuch as
their cause, notably that of the former, has from the days of
Lipsius found stauuch adhercnts among scholars of repnte, we must
needs enumerate, as briefly as possible, the reasons on the basis of
which their case would have to be summarily rejected, even if the
Tacitean authorship of the Dialogus isere less firmly established
than it is.

The l’liuian hypothesis ¹¹⁸ need not occupy us very long, for the
reasons which N ast, Hess, Wittich and Kramarezik have advanced
are either ridiculously absurd or absolutely gratuitous. The spuri-
ousness of the treatise was of course talren for granted and tho
numerous insuperable obstacles in the way of their theory persist-
eutly and ‹lisingenuously ignored. We are told, among other things,
that the drarrratic dats of the Dialogus admirably agrees with the
ascertainable data in l'liny’s life, that Pliny was by virtue of his
oratorioal training and taleuts peculiarly fitted to discuss the prob
lem dealt with in the Dialogue., thatin fact the method of treatment
of the subject is quite in the nranner lrnown to us from his corre-
spondente! Fabius Iustus also, to whom the treatise is addressed,
is repeatedly and siguifioautly mentioned iu the letters as a friend.
