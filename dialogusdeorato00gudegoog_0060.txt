of an over-ingenious subtlety of analysis, are but called forth by the
infinite stylistic capabilities of the languages themselves. That
oratory and history, with which we are here more immediately
concerned, demand different rhetorical treatment, is particularly
emphasised in a well-known passage of the younger Pliny.¹⁰²

These two causes, then, the psycholoqical and the rhetorical, taken
in connection with the long interval of years that had elapsed
between the publication of the Dialogus and the larger historical
writings, would in themselves be sufficient to account for the
stylistic change which confronts us.

An examination, however, of the Agricola and the Germania, Geuetic
which are chronologically intermediate between the Dialogus and mmm*
the Annals, shows that still a third factor had its share in effecting
the change under notice. For we observo that the Agricola and
the Germania have still many stylistic features in common with
the Dialogue which one would look for in vain in the subsequent
writings. Again‚ not a few characteristic usages, still rare in the
Dialogus, occur with constantly increasing frequenoy in the later
works, while others common in the Dialogus show a corresponding
decresse, often disappearing entirely in the Annals. In other
words, the style of Tacitus, as it is revealed to us in its maturest
and latest form, is to a considerable extent the result of a penetra
decebpnwnt, passing gradually through various pheses of growth or
decay, which we are often still able to traoe. This fact, thanks to
Woelfflin, is now all but universally admitted,¹⁰⁸ and it will, there·
iore, suffice for our present purpose to illustrate the point by
adduoing a few salient examples.¹⁰⁹

1⁰⁷P1in. Ep. V 8, 9 i. habet quidem oratio et historio multa communia sed
plura diversa in his ipsis quae communia videntur, narrat illa, namet haec sed
aliter: huic pleraque humilia et sordidast ex medio petita, illi omnia recondita,
splendida, excelsa conveniunt: hanc saepius ossa musculi nervi, illam tori qui·
dam et quasi iubae decent: haec vel maxime vi amaritudine instantia, illa
tractu et crassitate atque etiam dulcedine placet: postremo alia verba, alius
sonus, alla constructio.

¹⁰⁸ Wolff, Die Sprcche dea Tacitus and Sohanz l. c. are, so iar as·I know, the
only scholare who seem disposed to question the truth oi Woelfflin’s observation,
bnt even wolfi does so only in part, while Sohanz merely denies it without the
slightest attempt at refutation.

¹⁰⁹ cp. also Jansen pp. 73-78 Weinkauli pp. cxxxvii-cxlii. This index corn-
parativus abounds in erroneous references and irrelevant quotations, and may
so iar as aulatis questions are concerned‚ be practically dispensed with, the
monumental La. Tac. being nearly completed.
