NOTES.

Secundus had declined tc act as umpire ln terms which leave no doubt of
hIs sincerity. Aper cannot, therefore, be made to ignore this refusal 1111111-
beck lit. Mus. XXVIII obn, Gilbert Fleclc. Jatrt. 1886 p. 204 and Wolff ad
loc. coutend, a view which they themselves are unable to maintahr with-
out arbitrary changes in the text. The words ‘securus . . . possit¹ are
simply designed as John, Correspbl. I p. 1-3, has convIncIugly shown, to
jeopardise the position of Maternus in the followiag debate, by deprivIng
him of influential outsidc support. By the aforesaid refusal of Secundus,
Aper feels at liberty to impose conditIons which he under other circum-
stances had no right to suggest, he being as prejudiced a party on the one
side as Secundus on the other. 'Ihcre can, therefore, be 110 reasonable
doubt that the clause ‘quatenus . . inveniri' must contain a acontiae idea.
The calendations of ‹Iolm and andresen are prompted by a desire to retain
‘inveniri' which, as it stands, isunintclligible. But their conjectures laclr
the palaeograpldcal simplicity of the reading aaa inveni (hinv.) gIven in the
text. 'lhe Infinitive Inveniri wem caused by the non patiar following. -Of
the nurnerons emendations proposed in place cf ‘apud eos? the reading
of all our MSS„ with the exception of D (ipsos), te is out of the question,
for Secundus does 1101 assume the rble of arbiter ; cos would include the
author himself who throughout the entire treatise keeps studiously in the
background, nor is it at all likely that Aper would have asked his young
pupll to sit in judgment upon tlatemus. Tho same obJ'ection applics to
cca, Ipsos or lios (Peterson). Eum is syntactically, sccemryuam palaeo-
graphically inadmissiblc. Nos (tlohn), however, is an easy correction and
in perfect keeping with the context of the portatgo. Andresen objecta to
it because of tlie preceding ‘ego' Nos, however, is 1101 the plur. maiestatis
but includes Secundus. And even ff it were, sirnilar examples of inconcin-
nitas might easin bc adduced from Tac. and other writers: e. g. II. IVb
incidimus. . repetam. Ag. 43 nobis nihil 0011101111, adfirmare ausim. Ann.
xlv aa in nobis . . . existimabam. Cp. also shakespeare, Jul. Caesar: If
thou be'st not lnnrmrtal, look about yon. -Et finally has been defended
by John l. c.. bnt as it is quite superfluous, it is perhaps better to delete it
as a dittography of the preceding syllable, a notoriously common error.
