that ‘per quae' is not strictly used for the instrumental ablativo,
as in c. 24 o, where see note, but in its original local sense with an
accusative of extent, here facilitated by its antecedent 'itineribus’
So similarly c. 298 per quae. ..inrepit c. 328 per. . . numeros
isse H. IV 'l per altercationem. . . provecti sunt, the metaphor being
taken from verbs expressing motion. This usage is poetic and
postAug. cf. Peterson, Quint. X 5, 21.

23 vi et potestate, non iure et legibus: It cannot have been Aper¹s
intention to assert, as might perhaps appear at first sight, that the
monotony and prolixity of former speeches were in his day partly
done away with, because the modern judge no longer presided with
equity and fairness, but substituted in their place arbitrariness and
despotic authority. Such achange would not have been a creditable
achievement of the new era which the speaker wishes to placo in
as advantageous and favorable a light as possible. Hence Aper can
only be understood to mean, that modern judges did not allow
themselves to be tied down to the letter of the lav, but occasionally
followed their own interpretation, enforcing it by the authority
vested in their office. See also following note. Peter who, alone
of the commentatore, seems to have felt any difficulty here,
supposes Aper to refer to the trials presided over by the priuceps
himself whose decisions were, of course, not necessarily influenced
by law or precedent, but this is intrinsioally improbable for tho
reason just given, nor is there anything in the context that lends
itself readily to so restricted an application of Aper's words. —Vis
is power generally, potestas the particular authority of amagistrate.
vis (orius) and potestas combined e. g. H. III 11. 39 G. 42 vis et
potentia Ter. Heaut. IV 3, 32 vim . . et potestatem Liv. XXIV 39
ius . . . potestatem Sen. Ep.1v,2 Gell. vssv Dig. IX 4,1. So
similarly, iare ‘legal code' is amplified by the ruore specillo term
lapibus, ‘provisions, enaotments' (cf. Cio. Top. V 28). Both are
grouped together e. g. Cic. pro Plano. 36, 88 deleg.15,17 Cp.
note c.9 1 (carmina et versus).-On the quasi-instrumental or
causal ablat. ‘in accordanoe with, hy means of,’ see Nipp. Ann. 111

Η.Ι28. 48 IV 12. 50 v23 Annllil II 75 III 24. 27. 43. 48 VI
20 XII 10. 29 XIII 16 XIV 30. 31. 62 XV 65, but omits the
present passage and c. 25 28 malignitate, invidia.

24 neo accipiunt tempora sed constituunt: Our judges do not bind
themselves, Aper means to say, to the time-regulations found in
