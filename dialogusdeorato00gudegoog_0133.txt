to the false solution 01 compendia, to scriptura continua and other
errors familiar tc the palaeographist. In about 17 passages (c. 71

3113 34 8), we must recognise the conjectural labors 01 Pantanus or
the copyist cf the Leidensis, which have in a number 01 instances ·
resulted in the restoration 01 the genuine reading. In 01111 other
casea, B, as we shall see, has been corrected from one or more
other MSS. Eliminating all these readings, we shall find but a
few variants in which B may with some degree 01 confidence bc
said to have rescued the original reading of the archetype (c. t 12
and possibly 25 21 26 30 3611).

3. The Vaticanus 1518 (D)²¹⁴ is a codex miscellaneae, containing
a Life of Horace, Porphyrio's²¹⁶ commentary, the Suetonius, Diolc
qus (fol. p. last-189⁸), and Germania.21⁶

The MS. was written by an unlearned scribe, who contented
himself with a mechanical transcription, being quite unmindful 01
the sense of his text. It is just this feature which constitutes its
value, for his apographon thus became a faithful copy of the
original; but the archetypon must have abounded in abbreviations,
which caused this copyist repeatedly 10 go astray. For among
about 130 variants peculiar 1ο D, over one third 000 be directly
traced to compendia. In many instances the scribe made no
attempt at decipherment, e. g. 10 ‘26 ib (= voco) 194 l (= ista,
illa) c. 202 fante (perhaps, as Andresen thinks, for ‘fabulantem'
the other MSS. reading ‘praefantem “), 28 12 d (301100), 319 phi
(= plerumque) la huit (= habuerit), 334 drama (= differentiam·
que), lit pt (= potest), 23 1ιι (= istud, illud), 36 20 mistus (= mar
gistratusl. 36 Ι3(30011110) etc.
