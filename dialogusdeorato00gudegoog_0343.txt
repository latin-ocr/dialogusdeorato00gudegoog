Brut. 17, 67. In the verdict of posterity, Cicero vvou a complete
triumph, although there were some in Quintilian's day who pre-
ferred his rival to all others. ln the elaboration aud polish of his
diction, Calvus was painstahing to a fault, so that his style lacked
spontaneity and force. Cf. Sen. Contr. VII 4, 6 compositio quoque
eius in actionibus ad exemplum Demosthenis riget Quint. X 1, 115
Inveni qui Calvum praeferrent omnibuS, inveni qui Ciceroni cre-de·
rent eum nimia contra se calumnia verum sanguinem perdidisse,
sed est et sancta et gravis oratio et castigata et frequenter vehe-

in Brut. 79, 273. The style of Caelius is characterised as harsh by
Quint. X 2, 25 (see also c. 2518) and as not f rec from archaisms (c. 21,
15-20. Cp. Teuffel ξ 209, 5-7. His letters to Cicero, filling Bk. VIII
oi the Epp. ad Fam. naturally do not furnish any criteria for
verifying these criticisms So much seems, however, clear from
the stylistic characteristics of Caelius and Calvus cited above, that
the uncouth diction of Galba, Carbo, etc.. can never have been to
them an object of imitation, and when this is asserted even of Cicero,
the statement becomes so palpably false that it is difficult to
believe that it can have been put into Aper’s mouth by Tacitus
Cicero's earlier orations unquestionably lached the finish and purity
of his maturer worhs, and he himself confessed to have profited
greatly from the study of his predecessore (el. Quint. X 1, 41 cnm
