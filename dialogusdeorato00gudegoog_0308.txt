we are assured by Baehrens and Andresen, is not elsewhere found
in the sense of ‘sacra loca' and the dictionaries, it is true, do not
cite any instances. N evertheless examples are by no means lacking
even in Tacitus, where this word, as shown by the context, ean
have no other signification, while in others there is, at least, uo
obstacle to its being interpreted in a local sense. cf. l‘ao. H. III

vatum carmen affero nostrum. The shrines of the Muses, as

remarked, were generally located on the tops ol mountains and in
the immediate neighborhood of springs, whence poete were said to
drinh inspiration. So Mt. Helicon, with the sacred springs of Aga
nippe and Hippocrene (Paus. IX 29, 3), Mt. Parnassus with the

Castalian spring (Plut. de Pyth. orac. 402 C). Numa Pompilius
dedicated a grove to the Muses next to a sacred fountain, because
they were believed to associate there with the nymph Egeria (Liv.
121 Plut. Num. 13). cf. also Mayor, ad Iuv. III 13 nunc sacri
fontis nemus et delubra locantur.

From the abore it must be clear that the passage isentirely sound, neither
the preposition nor ‘sacra' nor ‘fontes' presenting the slightest difficulty.
On the other hand, the generally received reading oi Ritter (ior even Peter
sud John join ‘in’ with ‘fontes' by assuming a kind oi zeugma oi the prep-
osition), besides being based upon a palpable misinterpretatlon, isopen to
other iusuperable objections. (l) The variation oi the preposit10n violates
a stylistlc usage oi Tacitus, pointed out c. 10 ao. (2) The anastrophe 01
the preposition is confined to the later writings oi Tacitus (op. Woelfflin,
Phil. XXV 116), and even in these, od lu anastrophe aiter aprouounis
extremely rare. Cp. H. C. Mane p. 71 Α. Gerber, Progr. Gltlckstadt 1871,
