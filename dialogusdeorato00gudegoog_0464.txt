John ad loo, following Sauppe (Philet. XIX 202), deletes ‘eloquentiae’
as an interpolation, perhaps caused by the preceding phrase ‘facultate et
usu eloquentiam contineri' This is possible, and it must be admitted that
the word is not essential to the context. But when John bases 111110011-
demnation upon the suppositlon that it is not likely that ‘usus eloquentiac'
would be here put down astho ultimate outcome ol theoretical instruction
rather than the result of aotaral experience, he. seems to me to misinterpret
the passage which (loss not 1111111)Υ any such contradiction to 0341111111
