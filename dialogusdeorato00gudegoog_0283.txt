the forum, 'is implored not to waste his strength upon ‘artes levi-
ores,’ lest they incapacitate him ior the higher calling of the
orator. Laoitutc is used, because the ‘iaculum’ (ἄκων, ἀκόντιον) was
a iiyltt weapon. cf. Lucian, Anach. 32 ext. κοῦφα ἀκόντια.

Andresen (Eotcmi. p. 169) deletes iactu, on the ground tlrat tha MS.
reading involves an absuui antithesis ‘quia diversissimi generis snut levi-
tatis et iactus notiones* But (l) instaures oi an analogous inconcinnity
ara not rare iu the Dialogus, ci. note c. l 21 and iactu may well have been
proterred, because oi the fondness ot our author, as Wolff ad loc. observes, ior
grouping etymologically related or phouologically similar words. (2) Andre-
sen unfortunately overlooked, and this is tatal to his emendation, that by
the deletion ot iactu, ‘levitas' is predicatod ot the diacus which was a very
heato missile, as compared with the iavelin. cf. Mart XIV 164 pondera
disci. Stat. Theb. VI despondero vix toto curvatus corpore iuxta Ι deiecit.

vanescere: a poetic and post-Aug. word, oi frequent occurrence
iu Tacitus, but comparativer rare iu other writers, only once in
Quintilian (IV 3, 8). Cicero uses the compound evanescere. Cp.
note c. 1 18. On the gradual decay of powers, if neglected, see the
remarks of Plut. An seui c. 16 (p. 792 A-D).

25 ab auditoriis et theatris: Dramatic performances were no
longer given in Rome iu the days oi Vespasian, Maternus' plays,
like those of Seneca, being book draums which the author recited
. before an audieuce, previous to their publication. The fictitious
eucouuters of the drama enacted iu recitation-halls are contrasted

with the real contests of the orator in thafurum. cf. Pliny, Ep.
113, 5 f. Nos enim qui in foro verisque litibus ferimur, multum
malitiae . . . addiscimus. Schola et auditorium et ficta causa res
inermis, innoxia est. For the use of military metaphors as applied
to eloquence, ci. Iuv. VII 173 ad pugnam qui descendit, and notes
c.5ext. 26 roff. 37 ext.

This eveniy balanced antithesis is rudely destroyed by et od causas,
an interlinear gloss to ocra proelio which subsequently iound its way
iuto tho text. Mahly p. 21 aud Knaut p. ll have, independently oi each
other, deleted the objectionable clause, but editors have refused to attach
any validity to their reasons. But the words in question clearly violate
