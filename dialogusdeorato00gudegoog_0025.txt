supposed to attach to the tronblesome and apparently irrefutable
objections derived ircrn the style of the treatise, they now happily
all paled into utter insignifioance by the side of the unimpeaohable
testimony of a contemporary of Tacitus! Quod volunt, credunt.
Among the many scholare who confidently and often iu very strong
terms⁹ expressed themselves in favor of the genuineness oi the
treatise, may be mentioned Boeckh, Niebuhr, Holmon-Peerlkamp,
Dronke, Seebode, Ruperti, Baoh, sister, Orelli, Doederlein, Sohopen,
Nipperdey, Messmann, Walch, Teuffel.

The consternation in the ranke of the opposition, caused by so
unexpeoted an assault upon what appeared to be a fairly impreg-
nable position, is' well reflected in the absnrd attempta made two
years later by Gutmann (1830) and subsequently by Fr. Hess, who,
though guided by different motives, both endeavored to neutralise
Lange's argument by contending that the letter in question was
not by Pliny, but by Tacitus, it having by some strange accident
found its way into Pliny’s correspondente! It might seem inored- ’
ible, were it not for the reasons given above, that Lange’s inference
should have blinded the eyes oi scholars to its utterly lallaoicus
character for a quarter of a century, for it was not till 1855 that

Haase dispcsed of it by convincing arguments¹⁰ Two years after

porary scholare : Die Zweiiel an dem Taciteischen Ursprnng unserer Schriit. . .

¹⁰ The grounds upon which Pliny's alleged testimony must be percmptorily
rejected may be briefly summarised: (1) The context oi the letter can leave no
doubt that ‘quae rr inter nemora et lucos commodissime perfici rurrs' and
the words immediately preceding ‘quas rc trs pariter colendas etc.⁹ refer to
one end the some source, but the latter statement has nothing whatever to
correspond to it in the Dialogus. (2) The parallelism in question is a literary
commonplace as old aa Hesiod's Theogony, and the identical collocation
‘nemora et lucos' isiound not only in other Tacitean passages but also else-
where. See my note to c. 931. (3) Το putas cannot possibly contain a reler-
ence to the Dialogus, unless we absurdly suppose that Pliny totally overlooked
the lact that Tacitus αονοιοὶο disclaims the thought in question as his own, it
being introduced as an opinion common to poets (ut ipsi dicuat). (4) It is
incredible in anu case that Pliny would have quoted a sentiment irom a trectise
of Tacitus written fifteen years or more previous, ior the adherents oi Lange,
with the exception oi Nipperdey, all agree ln assigning an early date to our
treatise. (t) The very vagneness oi the reference in a correspondence intended
