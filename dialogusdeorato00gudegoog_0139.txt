Moreover, EV agree 63 1111100,911 as against ABCDA. Of these
variants, 20 are of an orthographica] nature, and 10 give 1110
pennino readings, as against 26 in which the other MSS. are
correct3 in the remaining all 1110 MSS. are corrupt. EV is thus
seen to be an independent group of the Y class, a conclusion which
Scheuer places beyond all possible doubt by the following pas·

The coincidenees oi EV (11) with ΑΒ can therefore only be due
to the original agreement of Y and X. Α number of readings are
also cited by Scheuer (p. 31), in which E has a solitary companion
in B, which might seem to point to direct indebtedness of Eto B?
but this inierence is refuted by an examination of the following
table (Scheuer p. 32):

²²⁷ Scheuer pp. 12-14. 111οο c. 21113, misplaced by Scheuer.

²2⁸ The same conclusion is reached hy an examination oi the readings of the
Germaniam which Η(11111111110111111110)οο011111001110001110 relation to V, as Ε
does in the Dialogus. Cp. Scheuer pp. 15-17.
