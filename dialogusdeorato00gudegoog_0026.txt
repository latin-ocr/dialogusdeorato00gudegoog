Haase's valuable commentatio de Taciti vita, ingenio, scriptis,
Franz Weinkaoff published his first dissertation, De Taciti Dialogo‚ Weirdtcuff.
with an index comparativus, which was followed hy an index
Latinitatis in 1859. With the appearance of these weighty con·
tributions, we enter upon a new phase of the controversy, charac-
terised by a more or less general acquiescenoe in the genuineness
of the'Dialogus. Laying due stress upon the many remarkable
points of agreement in the general mode of thought and feeling, ·
the oritioisms on men and measures between our treatise and the
historica] writings of Tacitus, some of which Lange and Eckstein
had previously collected, Weinkauff for the first time instituted an
exhaustive stylistic and rhetorical ¹¹ comparison which showed that
the stylistic resemblanoes, even down to minutiae, were more
numerous and striking than even the most ardent advocates of
Tacitean authorship could have expected. Nevertheless, there
were not wanting oritics, like Bernhardy, who still insisted that
these coincidences were after all not sufficient to counterbalance
the equally striking deffereoces, and these Weinkauff, like all his
predecessore, had failed to account for satisfactorily. That was
reserved for Ecluorol Woelfflin who, in a series of articles in the Ε. Woelfflin
Philologus, beginning in 1868, proved conclusively by a large
number of apt illustratione that this stylistic difference is the
result of a genetic development which we are still able to traco
through the works of the historian, 'dass in dem Stilo des Tacitus,'
to use his own words, ‘nicht nur das Individuelle von dem der
Zeit Angehorigen zu scheiden ist, scudem dass das erstere Element
in den frhheren Schriften noch weniger zur Geltung kommt, sich
im weiteren Verlauf des Sohreibens starkt, und dass schliesslioh
Tacitus in den Annalen, wir wollen nicht sagen am besten schreibt,
abor eben erst der wahre Tacitus ist! ¹²

Five years before Woelfflin's epooh-making investigations,
Steinasss famous ‘Programm’ appeared, in which the paramount sarno.
validity of the MS. testimony is for the first time properly em-

remarkable. The quotations under notice were simply called forth by two lost
letters of Tacitis, to which Pliny's epistles 16 and lx 10 are tho extant replica

Schwabe's unqualified support of Iange‘s inierence even ln his last revision of
Teuffel’s Rom. th.⁶ 1331, l, can, in my opinion, be explained only on tho
ground of ‘Pietat' or negligente.

1¹ ln this, he had a predecessor in Pabst (1841).
