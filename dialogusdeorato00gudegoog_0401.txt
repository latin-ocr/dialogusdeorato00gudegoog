Ch. 24-32. After a few penerel remarks on Aper’s speech, Mater·
mes calls upon Messalla to melre pond his promise to discuss the canses
of the decline of eloquente (c. 24). Messalla lepins with a short
digression, tp first pointinp ont that the ancient oratore, thonph nn
questionalrlp differinp in depree, cirtnallp represent the same type,
which, Aperte content-ion to the contrary, is far preferable to the
sensational style of modern cratory. About to proce this in detail
(c. 25-26), he is apain recalled to the main theme at isne (c. 27).

some general expression such as ‘usus est’ having to be supplied
in thought. ‘Locutus' which Andresen following Doederlein prefers,
is not sufficiently akin in meaning to ‘nrutuatus,'-a necessary
requirement in all zeugmatis constructions. As Maternus here
