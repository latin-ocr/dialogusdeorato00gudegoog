We have 1ο criterion to decide between ‘cogitant' the reading oi the X
class, and ‘cogitare' oi Y. The tormer, however, looks suspIciously like
an attempt to round oti the sentence. -‘nihil' is preferable to ‘vel’ (AB),
because more in keeping with the 1111 01 the passage. It is also supported
hythe Ciceronian parallel. ‘vel’ may have arisen out oi ‘ nih’

was perhaps suggested by Cic. Brut. 24, 93 Quem (sc. Galbam) for-
tasse vis non ingeni solum sed etiarn animi et naturalis quidam
