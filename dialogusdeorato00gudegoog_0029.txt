Dial. in only two codices and of these one contains only Tacitean
writiugs! It any such transference had taken place, it was far more
likely that the name of Suetonius would have become attached to
our treatise, the more so as the Suetonian fragment also dealt with
purely literary topics. Nay more, on Haase's theory, we should
be compelled to conclude that, inasmuch as the Germania, preserved
in but a single MS, almost invariably follows the Dialogus, the
name of Tacitus was thence transferred from the treatise which
preceded! Again, it must be observed, that many awork handed
down to us under a definite name, would have to pass as ἀδέσποτον,
if critics cau with impunity discredit an otherwise unimpeachable
tradition, simply because it is based upon a single MS. and happens
to conflict witha pet hypothesis. In the present instance, such
reasouing would endanger the authenticity of the Germania and
the fragment of Suetonius no less than that of the Dialogus. The
archetypon, moreover, can be traccd at least as far back as the
aiath century, all direct knowledge of Tacitus, never extensive at
any time, having been wholly lost for the six centuries preceding
the rediscovery of his works.¹⁸ But the nearer we approach the
historian's own time, the more precarious becomes the suppositiou
of Lipsius and Haase, the more intrinsically trustworthy the testi-
mony of the archetypon.

Such being tlte case, we must insist with Steiner and lansen,
that the evidence in favor of Tacitean authorship furnished by the
MSS, is an argument of adamantina strength which can only be
demolished by contrary procis, overwhelming iu their number and
of convincing validity. It therefore follows that every examination
of other objections that have been brought forward since the time
of Lipsius must start out with the praeumption that the Dialogus
de oratoribus is as genuine a work of Tacitus as the Germania, the

MS. history of both being identical.
