etiam forte circumfusae multitudiuis compositi non ferunt illud
intentionis silentium: nec sibi diserti videntur, nisi omnia tumultu
et vociferatione concusserint— tot paritor ac tam nobiles etc:
The anaphoric ‘cum' clauses analyse the composition of the great
audience which laced the oratore of the Republic on important
occasions. The higher (nobiles) and lower classes (dientelae,
tribus), of the city arrd the representatives of municipalities
crowded the forum, and took a persona] interest in court trials.
John and Andresen strangely contend, that we must supply in
thought ‘oratores' or· ‘advocati’ aiter ‘nobiles’ the former under·
standing the large number of petroni present, bnt as these never
exceeded twelve (see note e. 38 5) ‘coartarent' would be a ridic-
ulous hyperbole. nobiles as a noun in the sense of the higber
classes or ‘patricians’ is exceedingly common in Tac. : G. 25 H.
1138. 92 Ann.12 1111.5e 11155 XI 23 XIII 1o. 18 xlvee.
On substantived tot, see uoto c. 8 25.

ll' tribus: i. e. the commonalty, tbc poorer classes. So Plin. V.
Η. XIX 4, 19, 54 in herbis aliqua sibi nasci tribus negant, caule in
tanturn saginato, ut pauperis mense capiat Mart. VIII 15, 4 ditant
Latias tertie dona tribus Flor. 116, 25 equitem imitatae tribus.
—Observe the symmetry of collocation : clientelae quoque oc tribus
.. . etiam legationes ac pars Italiae, each of the two members
joined by ‘et’ being made up of two clemente joined by ‘ae'3 quoquc
joined to the first member ol tbe first group corresponding to
‘etiarn' in the first member of the second group. cf. note o. 1712
and the passage from the Agricola cited below.

Halm was, therefore, wrong in writing ‘tribus ac' on the authority of
the reading in B.

18 pars Italiae etc: uf. Tac. Anu. XIII 4 consulum tribuna·
libus Italia et publicae provinciae adsisterent.—adsisteret: The
predicate in Tac. often agrees witb the nearest subject iu the sing,
even if a preceding subject is iu the plural. cf. e. g. Ag. 24 solum
caelumque et ingenia cultusque bominum baud multum a Britannia
differt G. 27 sua cuique arura, quorundam igni et equus adicitur
