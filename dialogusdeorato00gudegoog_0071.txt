THE lmnnecurons.

The scenery of the Dialogus is laid in the house of the poet
Curiatius Maternus. One astemoon¹¹⁸ of the year resta A. n., pre·
sumably ln the winter, as the conversation takes place iudeors,
Marcus Aper and Julius Secundus, two intimate friends, accom-

panied by a devoted disciple, the youthful Tacitus, call upon their
mutual friend and to their surprise find him reading the very
tragedy which he had the day previous recited and which had,
as we are told, given offence to the ‘powers that be,' because of
some pronounced liberal sentiments put into the mouth of Cato
Uticensis, the hero of the play. Secundus deprecatos the out-
spokenness which the poet has injudiciously thought fit to display,
and Aper endeavors to irnpress upon him the necessity aa well as
the expediency of entirely abandoning so precarious and useless a
pursuit, particularly as it must serionsly interfere with his forensie
duties. Maternus in reply, to the evident astonishment of his
visitem, expresses his unalterable determination to withdraw en-
tirely from the forum and the lawcourts, and to devote himself
heuoeforth exclusively to the cultivation of the Muses.

This announcement naturally leads to a discussion between
Maternus and Aper, touehing the intrinsic velue and respective
superiority of oratory over poctry‚ Secundus having politely but
firmly declined to aet as umpire, because of ineradicable prejudices
for one side of the question. The ensuing dehate, conducted in set
speeches, which admirably portray the character and convictions of
the two contestauts, is made to end in a draw, ior reasons to be
pointed out below, atum in the conversation being brought about
by a not uncommou dramatis device, borrowed in this instance
directly from (licere, namely, the introduction of a new speaker, in
the person of Vipstanus Messalla.

The neweomer observing from the countenances of those present,
that the discussion, interrupted by his entrance, had been unusually
warni and animated, it naturally fell to the lot of Secundus, as the
only passive listener‚¹²⁰ to acquaint Messalla with the subjectos
