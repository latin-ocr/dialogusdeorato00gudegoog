with this scholar's presentment of the case.³⁰

After dismissing, in a few words, the evidence of the Mss. as
worthless and dealing with the alleged difficulties regarding the
dramatis date in the traditional way, Andresen proceeds as follows:
The Dialogus cannot have been written duringthe reign of Domitian,
because it contains criticisms on rnen and mensures which could not
have been given publicity under that emperor. Nor can it have been
composed before Domitian, chiefly for two reasons. (l) The words
in the introductory chapter ‘quos eandem hanc quaestionem pertua
ctantes iuvenis admodum audivi' are unintelligible, unless we supply
in thought “and as a mature man Ι now reprodnce in writing, what
I then heard,'' butas Tacitus was 27 years old in 81 A.1>., he could
not have designated himself as ‘iuvenis admodum' with reference
to the time in which, at the age of 21, he had listened to the debate
in question (75 Α.1).),81 for we should in that ease have expected
some expression like ‘paucos abhinc annos! It is equally incred-
ible, that so deep a problem as the causes of the decline of
eloquence would readily have suggested itself to a youth of 27,
even granting that he possessed the requisite intellectual maturity
to grapple with it. Nor is it at all probable that Fabius iustus,
who cannot have been much moro than twenty in the reign of
ritus, had occupied himself with this difficult question atthis
time. (2) lt is incredible, that the passages concerning Eprius
Marcellus and Vibius Crispus (o. 8 aud 13) were written at a time,
when these powerful informers were still alive and in the enjoy-
ment of imperial favor. MarcelluS, it is graciously admitted, was
dead when Titus ascended the throne, but Crispus lived to a green
old age, highly esteemed by Domitian, until 93 n. n. Hence the
Dialogus must have been written, at the very earliest, shortly after
this date. But this approaches a period in which the style of
Tacitus had already been fully developed, at least in its essential

. features,⁸¹ and we are, therefore, put to the alternative of denying
