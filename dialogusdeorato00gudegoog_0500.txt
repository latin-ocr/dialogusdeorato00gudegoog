niscence of Sallust who uses it, however, 111 1110 001100 01 ‘in

well observes, because the phrase 'in the light 01 publicity' does
not admit of a comparison (altior), partly because forensia 010101)ν
naturally has its sphera ‘iu conspectu lrominum’ or ‘in media
luoe' (cf. 0. 3410), as opposed to ‘declamatio’ conducted within
1110 walls of the sclroolroom.-uyit expresses 1110 activity 01 010-
quencc, the personification being kept up throughout. On the
military metaphor, see Proleg. p. 011111 (11); 001110 personifieation
01 ‘eloquentia’ 01. c. 32mand110te c. 121. ‘The more blows

her antagonists and the fiercer the battles she engages iu, 1110 more
will her prowess win universal admiration, the more glorious will

There ought to be no doubt that the combined emendations 01 Latinius,
Lipsius, Boetticber and Orelli have succeeded in restoring the words 01
Tacitus which have been variously corrupted in tlrc MSS. ‘Nobilitatus
criminibus' arose out 01 ‘nobilitadiscrirninibus' (Vahlen, Prooem. 11011.
1881 p. a). ’1110 same scholar (p. 10) is disposed 10 retain ‘ipsas’ 011 1110

nevertheless admire perilons aelrieverneuts‚ although these are pos-
sible only under coraliticus, destructive of tlre very things they
fain would enjoy. Exactly the same observation and 0011011011 111
