From this it appears, theu, that the archetypou of the Ottoboni-
auus was corrected by an unknown hand aflcr the vindobonensis
had beeu copied from it, and in this emended state Pontauus 0r
the scribe of the Leideusis used it, the readings adopted being all
genume.

There remeius the question as to the interrelatiouship of ODA
and the very frequent agreement of D with the X class. This
problem has, in my judgment, also baeu solved by Scheuer. For
“ a glauce at the readings given ou p. cxxxi f. will show that ΟΔΙ)
form still another independent group (designated by Scheuer as γ’)
-of Y. As for D, which Michaelis regarded as the best represent
ative of the Y class, for the reasons given, its frequent agreement
with AB* is uow seen to be due to the fact that its immediata
archetypon (γ’) had been corrected out of some member of the X
family, after Ch had already been copied. The clear proof of this
is fnrnished by the following significant variants:

The iuterdependence of our MSS„ as finally determiued, may be
represented by the subjoiued family-tres, the arrows indicatiug in
what way the many coincidences between some of our MSS„
though derived from different families‚ may be accounted for:
