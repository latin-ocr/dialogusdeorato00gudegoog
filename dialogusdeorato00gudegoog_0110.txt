slight selicontradiction oi Tacitus, moreover, seems also to betray
an earlier source. The author makes Messalla say that the time-
honored custom by which a young man would attach himself to

some great orator, had gone out oi vogue in his day (o. 34 init), and
yet Tacitus represents himself in the introduction as conforming to
this very practice l Now this discrepancy is at once accounted for
on the supposition that Tacitus is here simply eohoing the views
oi his ‘Qnelle' But be this as it may, deny, ii you will, that
neither Chrysippus nor Varro was directly consulted, the fact that
the chapters on education are not entirely original with Tacitus
must nevertheless, on the strength of the evidence accumulated
above, be regarded as indisputable.

We have seen that the author oi the Dialogus is under the great
est oi obligations to previous writers, notably Cicero, but in spite
of this we cannot but admit that Tacitus, even in his youth, was
no servile imitator, but that he assimilated his borrowed material
in such a manner as to make it practically his own,²⁰² admirably
succeeding in producing a work, homogeneous in construction, ,
artistically elaborated in its style, and bearing all the outward
indications oi an original composition.
