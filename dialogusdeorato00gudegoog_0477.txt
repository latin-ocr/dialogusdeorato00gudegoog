c. 20 8 adfluens. But this interpretation places the emphasis upon .
a very seeondary element in the thought. Translate: For there is

With the exception of sed (set) which was corrupted out of est by
metathesis (cf. crit. note c. 1214), the rnuch disputed passage appears to
me perfectly sound. John, followed by Wolff, writes ‘utin quern. ..
intret‚' but has to have recourse toa ‘Emeuerung eines altlateinisehen
