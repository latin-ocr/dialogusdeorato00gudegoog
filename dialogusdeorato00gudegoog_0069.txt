(3) Some utterances which happen to be found only in the
Dialogue and Quintilian, so far as they might not have occurred
independently to two writers like Tacitus and Quintilian, may well
owe their existence ο10 our treatise to the fact that the youthful
author had heard them from the living lips of Quintilian, having
either remembered them or taken them from lecture notes¹²⁴

(4) There are unmistakable contradictione between the Dialogus
and the Institutio. cf. e. g. notes to c. 56 217 22 ta 35 ext.

(5) 10 01111 other passages Quintilian seems to take direct issue
with statements made in the Dialogue. Cf. 0. g. c. 120 231.

(6) The political tone, which, as we have seen, is the same
throughout the Dialogus and the historical rvritings 01 Το01100, 10
wholly different in the work 01 tho eulogist 01 Domitian.

(7) The chronological data of the 1110 of Quintilian are absolutely
incompatible with the theory under discussion. The writer 01 the
Dialogue was a very young man in 't' 5, but Quintilian nearly forty
at that time. The author of the treatise tells 00 that in 'i 5 he
was still assiduously pursuing his lorensic studies under the
guidance of Aper and Secundus 3 Quintilian, on the other hand, is
known to have been a pupil 01 Remmius Palaemon (schol. luv. VI
451) and especially 01 Domitius Afer, as he tells us himself (V 7,7
X 1, 86). Aper is never mentioned, Secundus repeatedly (X 1, 120.
3,12 XII 11111), but 00 an intimate friend and equae ia aye
(aequalis), and when Secundus and Aper, accompanied by their
young pupil, paid their visit at tlte house of Maternus, Quintilian
had been for three years or more the occupant 01 a professorship
of rhetoric established by vespasian.¹2³

Β* That his pupils were wont to take notes is not only intrinsically probable,
but is expressly attested in a well-known passage 01 the Institutio, 1 prooem. 7 :
duo iam sub nornine meo libri ferebantur artis rhetoricae neque editi a me
namque alterum sermonem per biduum habitum pueri, quibus id praestabatur,
exceperant, alterum pluribus sane diebus, quantum 00101010 consequi poterant,
interceptum boni iuvenes sed nimium amantes mei temerario editionis honore
vulgaverant. Wilamowitz's (2) statement cited by Reuter p. 63 “Tacitus'
Dialog ist der 1101100(1000011111110001001100 Kritik in der Seele eines Histori-
kers,” though nicely put, is only partially true, 00 11 irnplies too late a (1010 for
the composition 01 1110 10001100. 00 Tacitus 00 0 pupil 01 Quintilian, see Liebert
(cited 0010 33), Gruenwald pp. 1911. Walter p. 10 ff. and below, note 147,

¹²⁶ These chronological objections 01000 are οο completely subversive 01 the
Quintilianean hypothesis. that its latest advocate, R. Novak. takes refuge in tlte

gratuitous supposition that Quintilian intentionaliy concealed his identity·,
