responsible for the ubertas dicendi which pervadas the entire
treatise3 more concretely it is seen iu the writer’s fondness for
collocations ol amore or less synonymia and tautological character.¹⁰¹

from Cicero, our author often betraying his source by intentionally
inverting the order of the original collocation¹⁰⁰

But successful as thc author of the Dialogus unquestionably was
in reproducing the tone-color of Ciceronian diction, he was after all
but a child of his day and as such naturally as incapable as were
Quintilian and the younger Pliny, who imitated the same stylistic
model, oi entirely effacing all traces of the idioma and the usage oi
