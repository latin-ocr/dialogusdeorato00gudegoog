21 auditorium · -· ex invidis et faventibus: The prepositional
phrase, denoting the material 001 01 which an audience is com-
posed, is here joined as an attributive directly to the substantive.

134 ex virtute nobilitas, and so often with other prepositions as
‘a, de, sine! Usually, however, some verb such as ‘compositus
mixtus, constitutus’ is added. E. g. Tac. H. IV 37 mixtus ex
Chattis Usipis Mattiacis exercitus 79 (cohors) ex Chaucis Frisiis-
que composita. The present instance is particularly noteworthy,
because the prepositional clause is added as an attributive adjec-
tive, a collocation apparently found only with ‘sina' on which see
note 0. 32 21.

‘Semper novum’ is, in my judgment, an interpolation, 101· this epithet
was, oi course, quite as applicable 10 the audientes 01 the speaker's own
dayes 10 those oi the Republic. Hence the phrase 1100 no 01000 iu the
present context, which deals only with points 01 differente between the two
periodo. This suspicion derives strong 0111010οΙ support from the 1001 that

the MS. variants (015) also nnmistakably point to a supralinear gloss
which subsequently intruded into the text in (1111010111 places.
