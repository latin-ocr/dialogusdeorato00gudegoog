Iam convinced that the explanation given by Becker and fol·

lowed by Habbe is the only true solution oi the problem, but their
argumentation seems to lack precision and cogency, and has con·
sequently failed to carry conviction. Perhaps the following remarks
may contributa something to the more general acceptante oi their
view.

The chief objection oi the conservative critics against the assump
tion of a lacuna seems to be that the MSS. furnish no clue to its
existence. But the non-indication of a lacuna is by no means a
clear procl of its nonexistence. For while it may be admitted that
the writer oi the archetypon oi ‚our Mss, may have been careful
enough to leave a vacant space, in the expectation that the missing
portions might some day be found, thc scribes of a later age, no
longer cherishing such hope, would either content themselves with
a few dots or a vacant space, which in turn might be easily over·
looked by subsequent copyists, or else they would at once write on
continuously, thus covering up all signs of an original gap. That
this happened repeatedly iu actual practice is a fact indisputably
established by palaeographical research; nor arc such neglected
lacunae confined to the omissions of mere words and phrases¹⁶² Το
show the inherent weakness of the objection in question, it is only
necessary to draw attention toan instance very near at hand, which
has nevertheless been completely overlooked even by the supporters
of a second lacuna in the Dialogus. I refer to the condition of Bk.
