NOTES.

cannot be right. We require either ‘non in iudiciis modo’ or ‘non modo
in iudiciis.¹ The position of ‘utrosque’ cannot be accurately determined,
but the strong tendency of Latin writers to bring prououns into J'uxtaposi·
tion, favore the reading given in the text or ‘quos utrosque ego* The word
was probably accidentally omitted by the scribe and then replaced above the
line, whence it was subsequently transferred to the text in the wrong place.
Rider, followed by Halm and Novak, solve the difficulty by deleting the
utrosque, but this is wholly unjustiflable, no motiva for interpolating this
word being conceivable.

‘v' in publico: 'in public places! Usually opposed to ‘domi' also
to ‘in privato,' e. g. S. C. de Bacch. neve in poplicod neve in prei-
vatod. Heraeus’ (H. 1 19) distinction between ‘in public places'
and ‘in the open street’ is strained and unneeessary. For similar
· adverbial expressions of ‘in' with abl, of which Tacitus seems
especially fond, op. A. Gerber, De risit praep. p. 11 f.—adseoteber:
'attended waited upon) So sectari o. 20 14 and 34 4 huno sectari,
hunc prosequi, and not rare in classic writers. Peter taking the
word too strictly in the sense of ‘to follow,’ is in consequence
cornpelled to assume a zeugma with domi, which, though slight iu

itself, is obviated by the interpretation just given. For similar
expressione, such as se conferre, applicare, dicare, cp. Scyth-Milli

Lael. p. 9. It will be observed that T. here professes to have still
followed the time-honored custom, the total extinction of which he,
in a later chapter (34), deplores. cf. also Quint. XII 11, 5: fre·
quentahunt vero eius (sc. Domiti Afri) domum optimi invenes more
veterum.

8 cupiditas: Α good example, first pointed out by Woelfflin, to
illustrate the geuetic development in the style of Tacitus. ‘Cupidi-
tas' occurs in but three other places in the smaller works (Ag. 15
G. 19. 35), the shorter ‘cupido' only once (Ag. 5). Iu the Histories
we find ‘cupiditas' 5 tinres (H. I 83 is doubtful) ‘cupido' 31 times.
In the Annals finally cupido has completely routed its competitor,
occurring 47 times. We lind the same partiality for the shorter
form in Sallust (23: 3). In Cicero, however, cupido is used only in

Α personifieation, aud Quint. has it only twice: VI pr. 13, X 7, 17.

—ardore iuvenili: The same phrase again occurs in Ag. 37. Quint
V112, 24 says iuvenili eupiditate, Cic. de fin. Ι 13, 43 cupiditatum
ardore, bnt Tacitus regards both words as synonyma-fabulas:
(1) ‘ordinary conversation, small talk‚' so here. (2) ‘gossip' -o.
3 ext. (3) ‘tales Mltreheu’—0. 29 f. (4) ‘legenda θῦμ’-ο.
3 21 Ann. x1158. (5) ‘dcarna'—Aun. XIII 21.
