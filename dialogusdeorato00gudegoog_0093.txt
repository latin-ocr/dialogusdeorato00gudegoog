Quintilian, Pliny, Juvenal and Tacitus. Only a few selectione
from Brotier’s restoration (?) can here be given, by way 01 illus·
tration. Thus the evercautious Secundus is made to fulminata
‘ingentibus verbis’ against the vices 01 his time l? Seneca, who
is dealt with at length, represents in his eyes the very incar-
nation 01 everything that is loathsome and corrupt in morale,
oratory and literature. Even Largus Licinius—save the 11101111

determination, and then suddenly comes to the rescue 011110100
much abused rhetoricians (i), Quintilian being lauded to the skies,
as a kind 01 prospective ‘vagae moderator summe iuventae, gloria
Romanae togae.’¹²⁵ Human affairs are then compared with the
human body, which passes 110111 youth to maturity, and 111011 10
deeay, and we learn with regret that nature is not prodigal 01 genius,
and 11101 every field 01 human activity has but one golden age, so to
speak. The language 01 men is a mirror of the times in which they
live, 01 which truth direct application is made. Maternus ends his
epigrammatic philosophy by a elraracterisation 01 the eloquence 01
Demosthenes, and then proceeds as iu the MSS. Some 01 Maternus’
utterances are not unworthy 01 the contemporary 01 1110 French
Revolution, and we actually hear 011110 1101101101 effect 01 elo-
