‘detectus’ ‘exposed himself to attack’ is also suited to the contem
it avoids the absolute use of ‘deiectus' and retains the metaphor. But as
no trace oi a variant appears in the MSS, Isee no reason ior rejecting the
traditional reading. Baehrens objecta to 'detectus' on the ground that
the word never occurs in the sense oi ‘intectus’ This is very trus, ior
‘intego' has exactly the opposite meaning!

20 non pugnat sed rixatur: Puyno is a battle in which the com-
batants are properly trained ; rico an ordinary quarrel that comes
to blows. cf. Liv. II 18 rixa ac prope proelium fuit Quint. II 12, 2
gladiator armorum inscius in rixam ruit. It is used of a ranting
orator also iu Quint. XI 1, 29 videas autem rixatores quosdam.
Both the noun and the verb are extremely rare in Cicero. cf. Verr.
II 4,66,148 turba atque rixa de orat. II 59, 240 rixatus, where see
Wilkins. The same criticism is applied to Calvus by Fronto Ep.
p. 114 N. Calvus rixatur. For numerous other points of resem-
blance between him and Severus, see the discussion in P. Robert
op. cit. p. 66-68. —ceterumz ‘But to return to my statement oon-
cerning Severus' viz. posse oratorem vocari. For a similar use of
‘ceterum’ where ‘ad personam regreditur oratio' cf. G. 43 valen-
tissimas (sc. gentes) nominasse sufficiet, Harios . . . ceterum Harii
and Anu. ΙΙ 34 Urgulania. . . ceterum Urgulania. ‘Ceterum’ after
a digression: G. 3 H. 1121 11135.

21 sequentibus· · · ceteros: The two terms refer to the same
persons. The tautology ie, however, excusable‚ being probably
occasioned by the necessity of joining an accusative with ‘superat'
-varietate eruditionis: “varied culture! Cf. c. 19 ὁ nec inscitia
litterarum.

22 lepore urbanitatis: ‘charming wit' Gi. Cic. de orat. 15, 17
lepos... eruditio urbanitate coniuncta, with Wilkins’ notes.
‘urbanitatis' is apparently only added for the sake of the libration.
-virium robore: This collocation is especially frequent in Livy:
e. g. XXII 40 XXIII 26 XXIV 48 XXVII 46 XXXIII 4. Curt.
VII 3, 4. viriam is here perhaps best taken in the figurative
sense of ‘mental iorces‚' thus retaining the military metaphor so
carefully sustained throughout this paragraph—This favorable
view oi the oratorical taient of Severus is, in spite of sundry
adverse criticum, fully shared by Sen. Contr. III praef. 3 tantun-
dem erat in homins quantum in ingenio and hy Quint. X 1, 116
multa, si cum iudicio legatur, dabit imitatione digna Cassius Severus
qui, si ceteris virtutihus colorem et gravitatem orationem adiecisset,
ponendus inter praecipuos foret. nam ingenii plurimum est in eo.
