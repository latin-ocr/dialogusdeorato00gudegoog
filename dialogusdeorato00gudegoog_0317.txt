restricted signification which Secundus gave to it ln the preceding para- Ι

graph, in which case all reference to Maternus’ splendid contribution would
be entirely wanting in Messaiia's answer. But (i) no valid reason bns been
> or can be adduced why the speaker could not have used ‘sermo' in the
same sense as in his introductory remarks (= ‘conversation discussion ’),
the more so, as the subtie distinction made between ‘sermo' and ‘oratio’
by Secundus is not confirmed by general Latin usage. Cf. Quint. II 21, 1

habere naturam sermo vulgaris, aliam viri eloquentis oratio Victorinl.

Cic. Orat 19, oi demands of an ‘oratio’ as distinguished from ‘sermo‘ arc
certainly as abundantly found in Aper¹s speech asin that of Maternus, nor
can the former’s argument be legitimately characterised as being ‘finitima
cotidianae locutioni' (cf. e. g. the figurative languaga in c. t. o ext 9 med.
10 med), and yet Andresen quotes the last two passages himself ln support
of his view. (2) The addition of ‘et oratio’ necessarily involves ibe further
change of ‘adfecisset' to ‘adfecissent' forasinguiar verb after two substan-
tives joined by ‘et-et' is extremely rare (see note c. 22 aa), and permis-
sibIe only if one of the subjecta were entitied to the greater emphasis3
but this would, in the present instance, be open to the identical obJ'ection
which prompted Andresen to insert ‘et oratio.¹ Finassy, it may be re-
marked that the emendation in question lacks sil palaeographical probs-
biiity. Cp. Am. Joar. Phil. xli ait f.

ista exercitatio inventa sit, pervident (See ΙΙ 4, 41 Scn. Contr.I
praei. 12). These 'exercises' mor-cover, arere. held both in private
and in public. cf. Sen. Contr. Ili 12, where Cassius Severus gives
among his reasons, why his ‘vleclamationes’ were inferior to his
forensia speeches: adsuevi non auditorem spectare sed iudicem
and esp. 18 vix iarn obtineri solet, ut declamern (i. e. before a large
audience) illud obtineri non potest ut veiim aliis quam familiaris·
