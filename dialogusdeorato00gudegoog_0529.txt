8 cnm annuissent, discessimus: The commentatore have ignored
and most translators missed the nicety and significancc oi the
change of persons. The author was throughout a passive listener,
his youth prcventing him from taking any active part in the dis-

, cussion. This attitude is with admirable tact maintained to the

end, as shown by the usc of ‘adrisisscut' ior ‘amisissemus'-
Discessimus, however, is a dramatic device intended to mark the
formal close oi the debete, as ‘intravimus' (c. 31) had indicated
its formal beginning-For similar closing remarks, cp. Plat. Prot.
καὶ περὶ τούτων δὲ εἰσαῦθις, ὅταν βούλῃ, διέξιμεν· νῦν δ’ ὥρα ἤδη

καὶ ἐπ’ ἄλλο τι τρέπεσθαι. . ,ταῦτ’ εἰπόντες καὶ ἀκούσαντες ἀπῇ μεν.

Cic. de orat. I ext. et, cum exsurgeret, simul adridens, 'neque
enim’ inquit etc. de nat. deor. III ext. sed quoniam advesperascit,
dabis nobis diem aliquem utcontra ista dicamus . . . haec cum
essent dicta. . . discessimus.
