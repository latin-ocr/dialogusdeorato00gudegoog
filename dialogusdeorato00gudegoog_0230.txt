0 Saleius Bassus: Highly extolled by Secundus and again by
Aper c. 98, but not without a tinge 01 irony. Quintilian damns
him with faint praise: X 1, 90 (among the spic poets) vehemens et
poeticum ingenium Salei Bassi fuit nec ipsum senectute maturuit.
The 'fuit' shows that the old poet was dead, when these words were
written. He cannot, therefore, as is generally done, be identified
with the Saleius designated by Iuv.V1180 as 1001ιί1, 101 this satire
was written nearly fifty years after Saleius Bassus had been pre-
sented with a gift 01 500,000 sestertia (320000) by Vespasian, as
we learn from e. 9 25, and about thirty years after Quintilian's
remark. Nor is there any reason for supposing that he is the same
whose tragedies (Colchis, Thyestes, Niobe, Andromache) Martial,

use of eum-tum and turn-turn (common in Cicero and revived by
Quintilian), owing to the constant confusion between these forms
in our 11188, but tum when thus correlated with cum generally
introduces a stronger (as here) or more important assertion. Cp.
