5 adversus ‘as compared with! Cf. Ann. XII 15 nec luit in
arduo societas potentiam Romanam adversus rebellem Mithridatem
ostentantibus XV 19 labores educandi adversus fraudem . . .
adoptionis enumerant. Anu. III 29 and XV 63, cited respectivcly
by Peter and Wolff, are quite different. This usage seems not
to occur elsewhere, except in two passages iu Livy: Vll 32 quid
autemesse duo prospera. . . bella Sanmitium adversus tot decora
populi R. and XXIV8 adversus veterem imperatorem com-
parabitur.

bleeundissima: 15 this figurative sense, the word is post
Augustam In Tacitus again: 15151 1192 IV 50 55511127
xlv 13 but not used absolutely as here.

7 quem admodum in comparative clauses is extremely rare in
Tacitus. cf. Ann. 11155 ut quem admodum temporum vices ita
morum vertantur VI 24 ut q. . . . complevisset, ita. . . exsolveret.
See note c. 36 32.-iuvenes iem et iorum ingressuri: The et is
epexegetic, on which see note c. ‘l ld.

The words oi Messalla at the beginning oi the following chapter, as well
as the clear antithesis between ‘artibus instrui' aud ‘exercitationibus'
strongly favor ‘ingressi’ as the original reading. Writing ‘ingressuri' we
should also expect ‘ct iam 15555,1 as suggested by Ernesti, or ‘et iorum
iam.'—Cornelisse11’s easy emendation ‘conformare' commende itseli on
two grounds: it is more closely allied in meaning to ‘alere' and avoids
the ὕστερον πρότερον. 'iiie word isused in the same figurative sense in Tac.

11 abnues = negabis. The acc. with inf. after ‘abnuere' in this
sense is still rare in Cicero e. g. de leg. I 14, 40 but more common
in Livy. Iu Tac. e. g. H. 11154 abnuenti vera esse quae adferret
Anu. XV 22 abnuentibus consulibus ca de re relatum. cp. Woelfflin,
Archia IV 581.

12 significare vultu videntur: We urrist supply ‘se nou abnuere'
not ‘eloquentiam contineri,' as is clearly indicated by ‘vultu'

by Cic. Fragm. Ilortcns 4 Or. quodcum uterque nostrum adnu-
issent.—quoque· - · idem: The saure pleonastic collocatimr, if such
it be, is found e. g. Quint. XII 3, 4 idem Graecos quoque factitasse.

Maternus had previously inferred the acquiescence of Aper and
Secundus only by their negative attitude, now they both gave

positive assent.
