PROLEGOMENA. - lxvii

This amusing paradox ’ must, of course, be rejected, but does the
alleged incongruity of o.1-13 and 14-42, which gave rise to it,
really exist? Is the first part of our treatise, as scholars have
hitherto either tacitly or expressly assumed, nothing more than a
kind of dramatic setting or frama-work, designed primarily to bring
out some of the interlocutors into strong relies? Iam disinolined
to rest satisfied with this explanation, for I regard it as an unjusti·
fiable aud unmcthodical proceeding to stamp one third of an entire
work as virtually irrelevant and external to the principal theme,
which in the remaining portione exhibite an undeniable unity and
consistency of plan. We must therefore look for some closer inter·
dependenoe between these parts, and perhaps the following oon-
siderations may go to prove that such a linlr does indeed exist.

It has often been observcd that Latin literature of the first
century bears an unmistakable poetioal coloring, and that poetical
effusione greatly preponderate over prose productione. ‘Scribimus
indocti doctique poemata passim’ might well serve as the motto of
this period. Even prose, in order to pleaee, bad to clotbe itself in
poetical raiment, and so Aper, the passionate advocate of the elo-
quenoe of his time, continually insiste that a speech must, above
all, possess rhythm and poetioal imagery. cf. e. g. o. 2018 exigitur

iam ab oratore etiam poeticus decor 2213 sensus apte cadunt et
quodam lumine terminantur 20 ‘26 marmore nitent et auro radi-
antur. Eloquence, in the beautiful peroration of Messalla (c. 32),
once the queen of all the arte, who held sovereign sway over the

souls of men, is now banished from her proper realm; she is
stripped of her retinue, without honor, without freedom. But, so
we may add, keeping up the personification, her life was not
extinguished, but she passed as a slave into the hands of poetry.
Hence it is that the poetry of the age is saturated throughout with
oratorioal elements3 it had become declamatory, as prose had
become poetical, making free use of the poet's voeabulary and con-
