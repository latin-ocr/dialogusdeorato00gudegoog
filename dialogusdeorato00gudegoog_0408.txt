oratoribus rarus obtrectator, on which sce Furueaux and loh.
Mbller, Beitr. llI p. 46 ff, l recognise in Ag. 34 cpuos quod tandein
invenistis, reon restiterunt sed deprehensi sunt, a very similar
construction-invicem ss obtrectaverunt: 1110110111 on the arialogy
oi ‘inter se,' its classical equivalent, is generally used without
anadditional ‘sc’ and so invariably elsewhere in Tacitus, barring
oue exception iu Ag. 6 invicem se anteponendo. Sirnilar examples
are by no means rare in Silver Latin 01111111.Ε11.1117,15011111

Nipperdey (1111011. llus. x1x 571 1. and 111111. xlv 11) 10 whom the
above passages were 1111101111110101)1 unknown, refused to accept ⁴ invicem se’
as correct Latin. The very awkward exception in the Agricola he promptly
dispcses 01 by gravely laying down the rule that ‘se' may be added, for
the sake 01 clearness, 11 the verb cau also govem a dative case, arole which
its author abandons at once by deleting ‘se' in our passage, apparently
iorgetting that ‘obtrectare‘ with the acc. 01 the person in place 011110

211 Asinium: Asinius Polli0, though well-known as a malevolent
(111110 (cp. Teuffel 1221, 6) had not been included by Aper in c.
18 20 to which passage Messalla expressly refers. But this incon-
sistency, as Vahlen, Prooem. 1878s9 p. 11 has pointed out, is no
111010 open to criticism than the similar instances of incongruity in
Q. 3 20 01 25 31, where see notes.

‘et invidere‘ has generally been atheiised as an explanatory gloss to
‘livere‘ but, arcuationem. p. 31 has convincingly shown, the two
verbs are by no means synonymons and, even 11 they were so, the deletion
01 011001 them would not be justitiable, in view 01 the fondness 101 syno-
uymic collocatione which characterises this treatisc. The genuineness 01
‘invidere‘ is, moreover, clearly demonstrated by the observatiou that
‘ceteri' and also ‘alii' invariato refer back to a aaronitae antecedent
which, with tbc reading hitherto adopted, could only be supplied 110111 the
intinitlve. This difficulty is disposed 01 by thc easy correction 01 ‘livere’
iuto ‘livore’
