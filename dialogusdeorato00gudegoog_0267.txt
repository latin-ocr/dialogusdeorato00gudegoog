11 negotium is regarded by the commentators as equivalent to
‘negotium forense’ (so c. 14 16 Quint. Ι 12, 7), as in Quint. IV 2, 27
XII 9‚8 and in Tacitus c. 19 ab 389 Arm. II 27 IV 15 XIII 4
XVI 22. But as Aper, with admirable urbanity‚ suppressos the
real object of Bassus’ consultation 01 0 lawyer, it will be preferable
to take negotium also as an intentional euphemiam. Translate:
‘should he become involved in some difficulty' or ‘meet with any
trouble! This meaning 01 negotium occurs in all periods 01 the
language e. g. Plaut. Men. V9, 13 Poen. 12, 30 Cio. ad fam.11110‚1
de 011. III 31, 112 Quint. V 12, 13 and 0010100. 320.

12 recurret: ‘Will have recourse to.' Very rare in this sense
101 1110 regular decurrere. cf. Quint. Prooem. 17 ad auctores
recurrere, 1 6, 13 ad eam rationem recurrunt. Here practically
equivalent to curret, for in Tac, as in Silver Latin generally, re 111
composition is often merely intensive. cf. G. 30 plus reponere in
duce quam in exercitu. Arm. XIII 57 residentibus flammis XV 73
revictam coniurationem. Sec also noto 0. 7 lt.

13 non qnia-neque ut: In place 01 ‘neque nt pro οο versus
facias,’ we expect some such phrase as ‘sed ut pro eo dicas, causam
agas, eum defendas! The slight anacoluthon was occasioned by
Aper’s reluctance to allude, save by implication, to the possible
contingency 01 atroublesome lawsuit in which Bassus might figure
as the defendant. On similar constructions in Tacitus, 01. H. 1114,
10 suadente Cornelio Fusco non quia industria Flaviani egebat, sed
ut consulare nomen . . . praetenderetur, and the examples cited by
Clemm‚ p. 128 A-According to Nipp. Ann. XIII 1 (where see also
101110001111010),11101001001100 is used after ‘non quia,' when a 1001

10 admitted to be true or likely 1ο bave been true, while its influence
upon the ensuing result is denied. So H. III 4 (above) Anu. XV 60.
