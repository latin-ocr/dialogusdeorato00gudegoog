30rassi maturitatem: maturitas significa the full, all-round
development oi mental powers and hence is used as a synonym of
‘perfectus' See Cic. Brut. 92, 318 (cited c. 22 10) and note c. 3 12.
The same epithet is applied to Crassus by Macrob. Vl, 16 sunt
stili dicendi duo . . .nnus est runcinus et gravis, qualis Crasso adsi-
gnatur. May not this be a reminiscence of the present passage?
Crassus is at least not elsewhere in extant writers so desig·
nated. —calamistros Maecenatis: calamistri, literally ‘ouding-
irons or crisping-pins.² The expression, in the figurative sense oi
‘rhetorical flonrishes’ is borrowed from Cicero who uses it twice:
Brut. 75, 262 qui volent illa (sc. Caesaris commentarios) calamistris
inurere Orat. 23, ta ne calamistri quidem adhibebuntur (sc. ora
tioni), where see Sandys' note. On the effeminate and florid style
of Maecenas, cf. Suet. Octav. 86 exagitabatque inprimis Maece·
notem suum, cuius μυροβρεχεῖς, ut ait, cincinnos usquequaque perse·
quitur et imitando per iocum irridet (See Macrob. 11 ala) and
esp. Sen. Ep. 114,4 magni vir ingenii fuerat si . . . non etiam in
oratione difflueret, videbis itaque eloquentiam ebrii hominis, invo
lutam ct errantem ct licentiae plenam 6 non statim cum haec
(the characteristic specimen of his style quoted in § 5) legeris, hoc
tibi occurret hunc esse qui solutis tunicis in urbe semper incesserit
sqq? In general, cp. Teuffel, R. L. ξ 226, 6-9 Mayor,Iuv. 166.
With the phrase, cp. also Goethe, Faust: Eure Redeo . . In denen
ihr der Menschheit Scinitxel lerdrraelt.

4 tinnitus Gallionis: L. Iunias Gallio, the friend of Ovid and of
Seneca Rhetor, and the judge who presided at the trial of St.
Paul, was the author of a rhetorical treatise (Quint. III 1, 21) and
‘declamationes' from which Seneca has preserved numerous speci·
mens cp. Teuffel, a. L. § 268, t. These cannot, of course, either
confirm or disprove Messalla's urrfavorable criticism‚ as is clear ’
from a remark in Sen. Contr. III praef. 18 ext. Gallio’s enduring
reputation seems to be attested, however, by Apoll. Sid. Ep. V 10
who predicates ‘gravitas' of him and by a passage in Hieronymus
cited c. 26 32. —tinaitus ¹ jingling style’ In this figurative sense,
the word is ἄπ. etp„ but its analogue ‘tinnulus' occurs once in
Hieron. Ep. 143,2 tinnula verba. So κώδωνες is similarly used by
the author of Περὶ ὕψους 23, 4 ἐπεί τοι τὸ πανταχοῦ κώδωνας ἕξῆφθαι,
λίαν coemenda-Observa the incongruity of the antithesis, the
comparison being in reality made between the penerel νναιονίεαί
