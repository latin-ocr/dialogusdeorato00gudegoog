mous character oi Severus' oratory is repeatedly attested. cf. Sen.

The MSS. read ‘vis,' which Peter, alone oi recent editors, defends The
chief objection against thIs reading is not the occurrence oi ‘vm’ as a
genitive, for this is admitted by the ancient grammarians aa a legitImate
iorm (ci. Neue, Fornacal. 1² p, 4116 i. Kohler, Acta Sem. Eri. Ι 390), nor
was Severus devoid oi force (see below and Robert, Cass. Seu. p. 19) but
‘vIs’ and ‘sanguIs‘ are invariata regarded as spaoapmoua. E. g. Quint.
VIII 3‚c sanguine et viribus niteat Χ 2, 12 minus rhium ac sangnInIs
habeant. Peter, Intent upon retaining the MS. readIng at all hazards,
does not shrink irorn taking ‘vis’ in the sense oi ‘nimia vIs’! “Dies
ergIebt sich,'' he argues, “aus der mit ‘enim‘ angekniipiten Erkliirung, in
der er (i. e. Severus) ‘incompositus . . deiectus* genannt wlrd, was neben
dem weiter dazu Gehbrigen (tr) nur die Folge einer zu grossen Heitngeit
und Leidenschait sein kann.'’ lt will be observed, that the other adverse
criticIsms contained In the ‘enirn’ clause are significantly ignored, thus
creating the impression that Incompcsitus etc. was directly and closely
attached to the preceding ‘vis' as an explanatory clause! A reading that
can be supported only on such gratuitous assumptione, does not call ior
serious refutation. Bilis, though less close to the MSS, than ‘vlri,' is
admirably suited to the context and more properly contrastcd with
‘sanguInis,’ both words belonging to the same class oi metaphora taken
from the human body. Cp. note c. 21 terit. note c. 22 22 and Plin. Ep. IV
11, 2 cui sententiae tantum bilis, tantum amaritudinis inest.

18 contempto ordine rarum: This fault was doubtless in a great
measure due to the remarkable talent of Severus as an extempora-
neons speaker, which would often render him impatient of
the restrictions imposed by a carefnlly prepared speech. cf. Sen.
