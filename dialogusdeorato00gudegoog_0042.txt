PROLEGOMENA. XXXV

lt may be well, at this point, to cast a brief retrospective glanae

over the ground so far traversed. We have seen that the testimony
of the MSS, though they are derived from a single copy oi the 13th
century, which may, however, be traced back to an arclretypon of
the 9th century, cannot be justly impeached3 we have seen that the
dramatis date of the dialogus, though hitherto open to doubt, owing
to a persistent misinterpretation of a passage inc.1l,canbe deter-
mined with satisfactory accuracy (visto an). It has also been
shown that our treatise cannot possibly have been composed and
published later than the reign of Titus (ts-81), every other date
involving us in insuperable difficulties; that the phrase *iuvenis
admodum' is free from objections3 that Tacitus, at the age of 27,

ia mmmoa with the subiect matter of the actu letter under discussion, and yet
Wutk triumphantly concludes: ex his atque talibus locis quibus probatur vel
madon cel similibus cel diversum) qnoque interdurn de eloquentia opinionibus
Tacitum et Plinium esse ductos, Plinium illam epistolam ad Tacitum dare non
potuisse efficitur si dialogum legisset, antequam ad amicum scriberet. Nosset
enim omnia qaae interrogatam esset in dialogo responsam. Ex quo coniicitur,
ut litterae a Plinio tum missae sint cum opusculum illud Tacitus noudum com-
posuerat (i. e. after aa an). Never, perhaps, bns an equally far-reaching
inferente been based upon more gratuitous and utterly fallacious assumptione.
ln the first place, it is aot true that the Dialogus gives an answer to l'liny's
question3 on the very contrary, it must have left him completely in the dark,
as it does every reader of to-day, as to Tacitus’ own opinion, for the author
impartially allows Aper on the one hand, and Messalla (c. 31) and Secundus
(c. 38) on the other, to give expression to diametrically opposite vicws, so that
the Dialogus, so far from rendering the ioth letter superfluous, might even have
induced Pliny to compose itl But suppose for a moment the Dialogus did
walaia a wtiqfuctory uaswer to l'liny’s iuquiry, it would still not follow that
the letter antedated the treatise. Wutlr accepts the Tacitean authorship, and
as no amount of exegetical sleightofhand (e. g. p. xi 1.) can dlspose of the

. obstacles ln the way of alater date than the reign of Titus, an interval of nearly

imelda years will bave elapsed between the publicatIon cf the Dialogus and the
composition of the letter, taking Wutk’s own date. This being so, is it un-
reasonable, 1 ask, to imagine that Pliny at the age oi 31 (born 62 a, n.) might
possibly have forgotten all about the passages in the Dialogus which he had
read at the age of 18-19, for according to Wutk, Pliny’s high admIration for
Tacitus precludes his gnorance of any work his intimate friend had written?
And if we add that the references in question ara but incidental to the main
· design of the treatise, it ought to be clear to everybody not blinded by pre-
conceived opimone that Pliny’s letter in no sense implies the non-existence of
the Dialogus. On Wutk’s own theory, finally, the publication oi the Dialogus
would be well-nlgb colacideat with that of the Historiesl Pliny alludes to the
