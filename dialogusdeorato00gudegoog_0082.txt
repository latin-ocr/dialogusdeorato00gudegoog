one of the many clear proofs of the identity 01 Tacitus with the
author of the Dialogue.¹³⁸

Full of enthusiasm for the sublime oratorical achievements 01
his countrymen, he representa, in pointed contrast to Aper, ths
uncompromising laudator temporis 1011 who is unable to see in the
eloquence of his time anything more than a deplorable corruption
and retrogression from the higher ideals and the chester models of
the republican period. This remarkable change he primarily
attributes 10 the prevailing laxity 01 home training and the per-
nicious educatioual methods of contemporary rhetorical schools,
which totally unfit the young and ambitione aspirant to forensic
reputation for the practical duties of his profession. The close of
Messalla’s argument is unfortunately lost in the large lacuna 11111
0. 35. 11 what follows, quite a different subject is under discus·
sion, which unquestionably points to another speaker. Can his
identity be determined?

The problem here presented is intimately or rather inextricably The speaker
connected with the question whether the existence of another⁰s ⁰· 3⁰⁴⁰&
lacuna, not indicated in the MSS.‚ must be assumed3 and this in
turn depende upon the degree of homogeneity inherent in these
closing chapters, a point on which critice even to this day widely
differ. The problem is rendered still more complicated by the fact,
that even those scholars who postulate a second lacuna are not
agreed as to the place in the text to which it must be assigned,
some holding that the gap occurred before the words ‘Finierat
Maternus,' while others insist that it must be placed after ‘admo-
vebant' (c. 41⁷). Still others deny the existence 01 any additional
lacuna whatever, attributing the whole argument 11011036-4210
Maternus. Under these circumstances, it will again be expedient,
before discussing what Ι hold to be the true solution of the diffi-
culties, to give a very brief historical surrey 01 the phases through
which this controversy has passed.

As usual, it was 1 remark of Lipsius which started the problem
on its career, for to 0. 42 init. in the first edition (1574) he 111
hapless moment jotted down these words: ‘Hinc colligere est

name of an orator, though eminently entitled to lt (0. 114 n), indicates perhaps
that the soldier and 1111 01 affairs took up the career 01 11 advocate mors ss an
