praeferenda—According to L. Mulier in Berl. Phil. Woclt. No. 24 ·

(1893) the opening lines have been preserved in Sen. Ep. 80, 7 En

impero Argis etc-Observa the artistic symmetry of this paragraph, ·

and the singularly appropriate groupiug of authors. Homer and
Demosthenes, by common consent the greatest Greek poet and the
greatest Greek orator, are opposed to Cicero aud Virgil, who oceupy
the same rank in Latin literature. On the Greek side, Sophocles
with Euripides, and Lysias with Hyperides, who are regularly
associated by the aucients, are contrasted with the orators Asinius
and Messalla and the tragedians Ovid and Varius, who are also
habitually grouped together. The Roman instances, moreover,
follow the Greek in chiastic order. Any other names, it will be
noticed, such as Aeschylus or Aeschines or Calvus, for instance,
would have totally destroyed the equilibrium of this fincly elabor-
atedantithesis(azssmzssssnbzazlbma).

ia. 1 contubernium: ‘Association with the Muses! Aper (c.
9ext.) had said that poets, in order to ascomplish anything, must
abendon the intercourse with friends and seek the retirement ol

necessary separation from friends by no means results in solitude,
as alleged, inasmuch as it is the peculiar privilege of the poet to
enjoy the society of the Muses and it is their inspiring intercourse
that he seeks. contubernium in this less concrete meaning is
common in the Silver Age. cf. note 55 and Kleiber p. 39.—
timusrim=dubitaverim imparts a touch of politeness to a strong
assertion. Cf. c. 26 33 non verebor nominare Plin. Paneg. 89,1
up. IV 9, 7.

2 inquieta et anxia: Opp. to securum et quietum. The same
redundsncy in Plin. Ep. II 9, 1 arixium me et inquietum habet
petitio. With the statement itself, introduced to offset Aper’s
glowing description of the career oi a successful orator, we may
compare Tac. H. IV 8 Ann. VI 48.

3 certamina et pericula: Pericula is added to ‘certamina' asa

more specifio term, according to the characteristic usage ol Tacitus
pointed out c. 9 1. On the technical meaning of ‘periculum’ cor-
responding to the now obsolete use of danger in English, see Peter·

son’s note to Quint. X 1, 36.—vel ad consulatus: Although the
consulship during the Empire retained but the semblance of its
