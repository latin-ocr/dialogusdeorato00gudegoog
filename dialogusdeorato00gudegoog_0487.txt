to say ἁπάσαις πόλεσιν ἔστι τις ε’νῬῶμῃ προστάτης. Tha reference
in our passage cannot, therefore, be to this custom, for Secundus is
speaking only 01 the honors which orotors were went to achieve,
and the well-known names of patroni, such as the Marcelli (Sicily),
Fabii (Allobroges), Fabricius (Samnites), which Peter cites, are not

known to us as orators. Iam rather inclined to sce, with Wolff ’

ad loc, an allusion to the words of Aper c. 3 18 cum te tot coloni-
arum . . . clientelae in torum vocent, where see note. Cf. also
c. 414.

19 f. hos ituri iu provincias magistratus reverebantur, hos reversi
celebrantia in order to have influential oratore to protect their
interests during their absence (cf. e. g. Cicero’s speech pro leg.
Man.) and to secure their powerful aid in case of accusatione (e. g.
tor extortion in the provinces), when they return. Maternus, in
opposition to Secundus, deprecatae the homage received by orators
under such conditions, not regarding it as anything 1ο be proud of.
ef. c. 41311. quis enim nos (sc. oratores) advocat nisi aut nocens
aut miser? quod municipium in clientelam nostram venit nisi quod
aut vicinus populus ant domestica discordia agitat? quam pro-
vinciam tuemur nisi spoliatam vexatamque.

20 f. hos · - · consulatus vocare ultro videbantur: The boldness of
this personification is somewhat lessened hythe addition of ‘vide-
bantur' which has the force of ι0110013-111100 ‘without effert on
their part,’ see note c. 5 23. Cp. the saying 'The office must seek
the inan, not the man thc office.'—This admiring comment, if at·
tributed to Maternus, would be irreconcilable with the low estimate
01 such honors expressed in c. 133 licet illos certamina et pericula
sua vel ad consulatus evexerint.

21 f. hi ne privati quidem sins potestate eraut: privans as op
posed 10 ‘magistratus' cf. Cic. de inv. 1 25, 35 privatus an cum
potestate Tac. Anu. VI 2 (8) privatos an e magistratibus XV 21
01110 quidem non modo . . . consul sed privati etiam mittebantur.
But in the imperial age, it often simply designated the ‘subject’
(11. Tac. Ag. 39 privati hominis nornen supra principis attolli
Mayor to Iuv. XIII ‹lh—pelastes is here somewhat loosely, as
also elsewhere in Tacitus, used as a synonym 01 ‘potentia vis!
(lp. notes o. 5 23 19 23 and Lex. Tac. a. v.—Cicero's struggle with
Antony may furnish an instance in point.
