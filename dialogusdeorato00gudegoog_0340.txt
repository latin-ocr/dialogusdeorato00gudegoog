the fact that these modern orators are not expressly mentioned as
the men with whom this close union is established. Bnt this was
not essential, because Aper’s hearers clearly understand that tha
propriety of the term ‘antiquos ac veteres' was not called into
question, unless applied to Cicero and his irrunediaie contempora·
ries, and so similarly, it is to thern only that ‘ex bomem oratorum
fama' in the succeeding chapter can be made to refer.

For this reason, the emendation oi ‘recentes’ ior ‘veteres‘ 1111111 be
rejected, quite apart from the circumstance that it is objectionable on other
grounds, for (1) ‘recentes’ would require the additional change of ‘ac'
into ι1111’; (2) the modern oratore are not so designated iu the Dialogus,
being called either ‘horum (nostrorum) temporum diserti (c. l o 14 11361)
‘novi rhetores’ (c. 1411) or ‘nostri' (c. 2011 ‘23 111211 7). cp. John’s excel-
lent and convincing note to this passage.

29 adgnoscere: In 13911111 7111 it signified ‘to recognise by
the sense of sight! llere the word is used of sense-perception
generally, or, more particularly, with reference to the sense of
hearing. N o other instance of this latter meaning seems 1ο occur.

18. 1 praedixi: ‘premised' In this sense chiefly postAugustan
and remarkably frequent in Velleius Kleiber p. 63, who cites
many exarnples, is, however, wrong iu supposing that this meaning
was introduced by Velleius, for we find it repeatedly in Terence
1. g. And. IV 4, 541111 primum praedico tibi. In Cicero 1111
used as a synonym of ‘vaticinari’ or of 'praecipere.’—iema

together. cf. 1. g. Cic. Verr. Ι 17, 51 pro Arch. 11, 26 de finili
