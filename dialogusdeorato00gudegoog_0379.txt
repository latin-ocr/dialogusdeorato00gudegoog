17 sordes reliquae verborum: Cp. Fronto p. 158 r. sordes.

‘illae’ though yielding a parfectly satisfactory sense, can, nevertheless,
not he considered as the original, ior it leaves us utterly at a loss to account
for the variant ‘regule' in AB. I cannot hut regard this word (with M.
Sorof) as a corruption oi ‘reliquae’ due to metathesis, a well-known source
oi error. The emendation has been objected to on the ground that in the
foregoing nothing had been said oi other stylistic hlemishes oi Caelius,
but this slight inconsistency is no greater than the similarly illogical use oi
‘alius‘ on which see crit. note c. 30 ao. The subsequent mention of Caelius*
shortcomings had, moreover, in a measure been loreshadowed by ‘sive
partes earum*

hians compositio: compositio like σύνθεσις τῶν ὀνομάτων refers
to the harmonicus structure of words and phrases. cf. Rhet.
ad Heren. IV 12, 18 c. est verborum constructio quae facit omnes
partes orationis aequabiliter perpolitae. In general, it includes the
whole subjectos prose rhythm (Quint. IX 4, 1-147). By the addi·
tion of ‘hians' the term receives a more restricted meaning, being
equivalent to ‘vocalium or verborum concursus, τῶν φωνηέντων
σύγκρουσις, on which see Quint. VIII 6, 62 and Cic. Orat. 23, ii.
44,151 with Sandys' notes. —inconditi nenena denotes the neglect
of the laws of rhythm in the periodis structure oi sentences (on
this meaning of ³ sensus’ see note. c. 20 lb). Cp. SandyS, Orat. 9, 3‘2,
44, 149 f.50,169; 53,179 f. Hirrus and irrcoaditus are virtually
synonymous with ‘hiulcus mutilus fractus, durus, disiunctus,
decurtatus, concisus, amputatus' and opposed to ‘aptus iunctus,
cohaerens, numerosus, suavis, finitus, coagmentatus, adstrictus!

18 redolent antiquitatem: cf. Cic. Brut. 21, 82 exiliores oratic
nes sunt et redolentes magis antiquitatem Macroh. Sat. 15 quid
aliud sermo tuus nisi ipsam redolet vetustatem.

19 antiquarium, a very rare postAugust. word. cf. c. 37 6 42 6
Suet. Octair. 86 cacozelos et antiquarios. Here equivalent to ‘an-
tiquitatis nimius adrnirator’ (Quint. II 5, 21).

20 propter magnitudinem cogitationum: Vell. Pat. II 41, 1
uses the sanie phrase in his comparison of Caesar and Alexander
the Greut-Propter, as a causal particle, though common in all
Latin authors, occurs in Tacitus only here and in H. Ι 65 propter
Neronem Galbamque pugnaretur, having been entirely superseded
by oli in the later writings, an idiosyncrasy imitated by Ammianus
Marcellinus. cp. Woelfflin, Arcani Ι loa-169.

21 occupationes rerum: The idiomatis addition oi ‘rerum' is
apparently pleonastic, but iu reality designed to impart greater
