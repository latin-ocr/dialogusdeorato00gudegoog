c. 1. a. 63

postero die: Far less common in Tac. than ‘postera die,’ although
the masc. gender of ‘dies’ greatly predominates in other colloca
tione, but without any distinctions of meaning. Postera die
seems not to occur before the time of Livy. Cp. the exhaustive
discussion in Neue, Formenlehre, I, p. 681-88 and also R. V., Ι.
p. meme-This opening paragraphis also modelled upon Cic.

eo Q. Catulus senex cum C. Iulio fratre venit. -catonem a fabula
praetexta dealing with the ‘nobile letum' of Cato Uticensis. This
sturdy opponent of Caesar was extravagantly praised in the early
empire by poets and rhetoricianS, being frequently made the mouth·
piece of republican sentimenta cf. Manilius 1 7 93 ff. Lucan Bk.
II and IX, and Seneca, to whom Cato represented the true Stoic
ideal of civic virtue. Cf. e. g. Ep. 24, 6 ff. 71, 15 ff. 95, 69 ff. 104,
29 ff. Dial. 12, 9 ff. - Catonem i. e. the tragedy Cato and so below
(Cato omisit, Thyestes dicet ⁹). On this very common metonymy
cf. Plut. de Isid. 379 Α. ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς τὸν ὠνούμενον βιβλία Πλάτωνος,
ὠνεῖσθαι φαμὲν Πλάτωνα καὶ Μένανδρον ὑποκρίνεσθαι τὸν τὰ Μενάνδρου
ποιήματα ὑποτιθέμενον.

2 ostendisse potentium minos: i. e. probably the Emperor and
his all-powerful friends such as Crispus and Marcellus. Vespasian
was a humane ruler and not easily provoked to harah and unjust
measures (cf. c. 8 20 patientissimus veri). Still, the hanishment of
Helvidius Priscus and the expulsion of the Stoic and Cynic philoso
phers (Cass. Dio 66, 13) were well calculated to arouse apprehensions
for the safety of the bold poet who so frankly gave public expres-
sion to his liberal convictions. The sentimenta put into Cato’s
mouth cannot, however, as is generally supposed, have been directed
against monarchical institutions as such, but were doubtless levelled
against the political evils which had grown up under them, for Ma-
ternus in c. 41 in perfect accord with similar utteranoes in the
historical writings of Tacitus, (see Proleg. p. xxxvi), does not advo
cate a return to a republican form of government hut, for reasons of
expediency, sincerely acquiesces in the existing order of things, only
deprecating the despotic abuse of monarchioal power. cf. Nipper-
