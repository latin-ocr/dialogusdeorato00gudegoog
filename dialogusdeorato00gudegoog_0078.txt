ancient type of eloquente, which ha regards as no longer suited to
the demands made upon modern orators by the altered taste and
the higher culture of his time.

In giving a characteristic tone to Aper’s diction, the author dis·
plays greater skill than in the stylistic individualisation of the
other interlocutors. It is typified by redundanoy of expression, a
fondness for metaphora, often singular and bold, and an occasionally
peculiar vocabulary, all of which features are far less conspicuous,
if not wholly absent, in the speeches of Maternus, Messalla or
Secundus.¹⁴⁸ How far Aper’s style is a faithful reproduction of
the original, can, of course, not be determined. The fact, however,
that the man himself, drawn to the life as he seems, has been
invested with some touches which were unquestionably copied from
Cicero’s portrayal of Antonius in the de oratore, suggests the prob
ability that Aper’s speeches, with their numerous Ciceronian remi-
uiscences in thought and phraseology, are also from the formal side
an artistic productiori of the author, the really historical elemento,
if such exist at all, being exceedingly few in number.
