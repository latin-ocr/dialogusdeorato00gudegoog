This being so, we should not be surprised to find distinet traces
of Tacitus' acquaintance with Seneca in the Dialogus. And accord-
ingly Peter,¹⁸⁸ starting out with this presumption, recognises this
influence “in der Freiheit, mit welcher, wie unser Verfasser, so
auch Seneca, nur in viel ausgedehnterem Maasse als dieser, dem
Sprachgebrauch Gewalt anthut, um den Ausdruclr bezeichnender
und ausdrucksvoller zu macheu '' and in Seneca’s fondness for
epiprammetic expressions.Iol Now it is curious to observe that in
the many illustratione given by Peter of Seneca's stylistic audacity,
the Dialogus either furnishes no analogous usage or, where it does,
the expression is neither peculiar¹⁹⁰ to Seneca, nor in any way
characteristic. The same criticism holds good of the formidabis
array of evidence accumulated by Kleiber.¹⁰¹ For of the 64 in-
stances of stylistic parallelisms between the Dialogus and the
writings of Seneca cited, there is aot a siayle phrase which can
confidently be regarded as a genuine reminiscence. For even in
the case of some synonymis collocations like emendatus et com-
positus (Ep. 4,1 Dial. c. 412) or quietum compositumque (Ep.
100,8 Dial. c. 36 h), which apparently do not occur elsewhere,
it were extremely rash to assert, in view of the demonstrable
fondness for similar fullness of expression, not only in the minor
works of Tacitus, but in Latin writers generally, that they were
taken directly.from Seneca! The other instances present at best
but a very remote resemblance, whether in thought or diction, or
they are of frequent occurrence elsewhere, or purely commonplace
and nondescript.¹⁹²

¹⁸⁹ See also Kleiber pp. 78-80. But this is a highly characteristic feature oi
the stylistlc individuality oi Tacitus, conspicuous iu all his writings. cp. p. xlii.

¹⁰⁰ This applies also to the use of incipit = sequitur with inf. (c. 16 ³2), for
which Novak (p. 186) adduces a number of parallel instances from Pseudo
Quintilian's Declamationes: 26‚5 quare si apparuerit te malam causam habere,
incipis rem iniquissimam postulare 166, 11 quotiens nullum praefinitum est
tempus, incipit esse 213,8 illo vero sublato incipit ultimum esse quod relictum
est. The others cited from 161, 9 and Quint. llI 6,17 are not in point.

Μ As it is inexpedient to reprint Kleiber’s entire list, I must content myscli
with a haphazurd selection, which will, however, be sufficient to substantiata
the statement made above: hoc euim vocari solebant (Seu. mailliaci and
c. is), toto animo incumbam (Ep. 72, 2-c. 31³), intra se (Dial. ΧΠ 5, 1-
c. 311), malignis sermonibus (Dial. Vll 17, i—c. 34), securum esse (Dial. Il
2, l—c. 69), rebus prosperis (sce note c. 62⁴), quicquid optimum est (Dial. XII
