6 maiores tuos: Messalla was the only native Roman iu the
company and hence ‘maiores taos,' used as a synonym of ‘antiqui'
(cf. c. 25 5 sive illos antiquos sive maiores sive quo alio mavult

· nomine appellet), is appropriately applied to the great orators of

the Republic whom Aper had criticised so unsparingly. John and
many others understand the allusion to be to Messalla's ancestral
relative, Messalla Corvinus, hut this view is erroneous, for it is
(1) incompatible with the answer ‘non suni offensus Apri mei dis-
putatione‚’ which includes Aper's entire argument. (2) Aper had
expressly disclairned any intention of attacking CorvInus (c. 21 ext.)
and while the reasons for this abstention are not particularly com-
plimentary to the ancient orator, it does not necessarily follow
that Messalla would have resented the criticism. (3) The plural
‘maiores' cannot refer to one distinct ond definite iudividual, the
parallel metanoea, cited by John from c. 34 3 and Cio. pro Mil. 7,17
in monumentis maiorum suorum being in no sense analogous.—
lacessendo: On the instrumental abl. of the gernod, cf. c. 116.

‘Apri nrei' seems to me a more methodical correction of the MS. reading
‘aprima' (aprini) than ‘Apri' which leaves the orIgin oi the corruption,
unexplained. ct. c. 5 ext. Maternum meum. ‘Nostri' which is also an
easy emendation, seems less suitable to the context. — ⁴ narn nec' or ‘nam
et’ is quite unintelligible and probably due to the false solution ol a com-
pendium. Andresen writes Apri nostri disputatione nec meo ros, but this
istoc violent a correction, the antithesis between ‘nostri‘ and ‘mea' being
also nncalled tor. See Steuding, p. 10.

8 si quid forte- ·· perstringat: ‘if ought perchanoe grate upon
your ears’ εἰ forte with snbj. also c. 33 32 si forte audierint Η.
11166 nisi forte . . . gerat IV 74 nisi forte . . . speratis. With the
phrase itself, cf. c. 9 ὁ licet haec ipsa . . . aures tuas respuant. and
Hor. C. II 1,18 perstringis aures. So similarly Anu. 113 Q. Hate-
rius et Mam. Scaurus suspicacem animum (sc. Tiberii) perstrinxere.

9 hanc esse eius modi sermonum legem: Iu this phrase, Tacitus
again unintentionally reveals the fictitious character of the Dia-
logus. cf. c. 14 20 28 5 32 aa-iudioium animi etc: ‘To give ex-
pression to one’s convictibus without the fear of injuring another's
feclings' ‘Adfectus' occurs in the same general sense in c. 23 25
sic exprimitis adfectus and H. I 15 Ann. XI 38 XIII 16. 21. In
c. 6 17, in the inore concrete signification oi ‘emotions' Ican see
no reason for taking tlte word here as an epexegetic genitive.

10 citra=sine Very frequent in postAug. authors, particularly
in Quintilian, but in Tacitus only in the minor writings. cf. c. 41
