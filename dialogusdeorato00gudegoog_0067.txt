to multiply objections ¹¹⁶ against the hypothesis under discussion,
it may be said that it bears 00 much resemblance to the diction of
the Dialogus as it does to that 01 110 1000100, Quintilian. 01110
many 000011οἀ parallelisms collected by Nast, Hess, Eekstein and
Vogel, by 100 the greater number, it must also be observed, belong to
the common vocabulary 01 110 language 3 others more particularly
exhibit the features 01 post-augustan usage and the stereotype
character 01 what may bc called the rhetorical vernacular of the
schools 01 110 day. More importantia the fact, that amid 00 much
01 unavoidable similarity, the diction 01 Pliny on closer 1000001100
displays, when compared with the style 01 110 Dialogus, so many
inherentdivergenoieS, asto render identity of authorship quite
impossible¹¹⁷

The arguments advanced in favor 01 Quintilian ¹¹⁸ are substan-
tially based upon the same observatione and consideratione as some
of those just mentioned. They are, however, more numerous, more
subtle and, 00 110 000-Το011000 0011000110 01 11ιο Dialogus 10 ex
hypothesi complaceutly regarded 00 indisputable, not without some
shadow 01 probability.

Lipsius and his followers were, it 00010000100001101 lured into
boldly deolaring iu favor 01 110 great rhetorician, not so much by
stylistic considerations as by the fact that Quintilian himself
repeatedly¹¹⁹ refers to a treatise, published but a few years before
the Institutio, entitled de 001ιοἰο comptae eloquentiae, for this
title appeared to Lipsius, 00 we have seen, 10 harmonise so per-
fectly with the subject discussed in the extant Dialogue that he
had no 00000100 10 identiiying it with 110 1001 10001100 01 Quintilian.
11 10 psychologically interesting, in this connection, to observe how
completely a preconoeived opinion was able to blind even 00 great
a critic 00 Lipsius 10110 palpable fact 1101 110 very quotations
from the ‘de 000010 corruptae eloquentiae' are not only 001 found

11180000010100101010. Iam 001 disposed to attach 100 much weight 10
the objection, based upon i'liuy's omission 01 any reference to Messalla or
Maternus, for these were doubtless long dead when the earliest extant letter was
written (07 00), 001 11 10 doubtful ii the alleged poetic reputation 01 Maternus,
alluded 10 only ln the Dialogus, long survived him.
