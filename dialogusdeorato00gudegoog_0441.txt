294 roras.

Orat. 1, 2. The rule of Seyffert, Lael. p. 104—106 that ‘est' takes
second place when it is the urere copula, but third place if it
denotes existence, is justly called into question by Muller and is
very decidedly refuted by our passage. The position, if not wholly
arbitrary, seems to be determined by the degree of emphasis called
for by the context.

25 exundat ct exuberat: Doubtless suggested by Cic. de oratI
6, 20 ac mea quidem sententia nemo poterit esse omni laude cumu-
latus orator, nisi erit omnium rerum magnarum atque artium
scientiam consecutus. Etenim ex rerum cognitione efflorescat et
redundet oportet oratio. Tac. uses these words in a figurative
sense also in Anu. XIV 53 tarn lato fenore exuberat (sc. animus
meus) and IIl 12 exundantes opes. —admirabilist Cicero repeatedly
contende that it must be the ultimate aim 01 the orator to render
his speech worthy of admiration. cf. de opt. gen. 4, 12 quid?
dubium est, utrum orationem nostram tolerabilem tantuin an etiam
admirabilem esse cupiamus? Quint. Vlll 3, 6 recteque Cicero his
ipsis ad Brutum verbis quadam in epistula (not extant) scribit:
'nam eloquentiam, quac admirationem non habet, nullam iudice.
See also Sandys' note to Orat. 28, ot. ln selecting this particular
epithet, therefore, Tacitus not only endorses Cicero’s own view, but
at the same time also pays every high cornpliment to his oratorical
excellence.

20 orationis vis ct facultas: Vis and facultas are frequently
combined. cf. e. g. Cic. de orat. 131, 142 Quint. XII 1, 33.

Andresen (Eiriend. p. 157 1.) objectate the reading ‘ceterae artes' as an
illogical correlative to oratoris, ‘rerum' in the sense 01 ‘artium' being in
his opinion also inadrnissible. The latter objection is abundantly refuted by
Cic. de orat. 15, 10. 0, 20 (cited in previous note as the model 01 Tac.) 28,
128 11122, 84 (quoted c. 32 ll). The inconcinnity pointed out may be ad·
mitted; it is, however, paralleled by similar incongruities iu the use 01
‘ceteri' and ‘aliua' Cf. Tac. ll. IV 1301000111 tantum legionum interfectis,
ceterum vulgus Ann.131 111 42 (where see Nipp.) XV a: Cic.Verr.Il,
10, 11 Nep. Eum. 1, l. The traditional reading might, therefore, be
plausibly defended. alleicurtem, however, vanish at once, 11 we write
orationis (an emendation curtly dismissed by Andresen) 101 ‘oratoris' The
two nouns are often confused in the MSS. e. g. in Quint. l 10, 27 VI 2, 10
X 2, 12 x11 1, ll. —The passages cited by h'leiber p. 30 and John ad loc.
ln support 01 the collocation 01 ‘oratoris' with ‘vis' or ‘facultas' seem to
me quite irrelevant, as no antithesis with ‘artes' or ‘res' is either ex·
pressed cr implied in any 01 them.
