difficulties on the other exclude the possibility of Tacitean author-
ship. It will be expedient to take up the latter objection first, but
to answer it successfully‚ it will be necessary above all to ascertain,
ii possible, the dramatis date 01 the Dialogus and the date 01
publication.¹⁰

ΡΨ Cornelius Tacitus was probably born not earlier than 54 and
not later than 56 Α. n.²¹

Now in c. 17 1011, Aper, tha champion 01 1110 modern style of
eloquence, in order to prove the purely relative meaning 01 the
term 'antiqui' and the consequent injustice of its persistent appli-
cation to the orators of the Roman Republic‚ draws the attention
01 his hearers to the fact that the interval that has elapsed between
the death 01 Cicero and the present day does not exceed the lirnit
of arnan's life-time. To substantiate this assertiou he gives an
annalistic enumeration of the reigns 01 the Roman emperors 11010
Augustus down to Vespasian. (Statue sex et quinquaginta annos
quibus mox divus Augustus rem publicam rexit. . . ac sextam iarn
felicis huius principatus stationem ’ἃ quo Vespasianus rem publicam

¹⁹ Some critice, like Lange and Urlichs 101 instance, in order to avoid certain
objections to which they attached undue weiglrt, suggested that possibly a long
interval had elapsed between the composition and the publication 01 1110 treatlse.
But this hypothesis 10 worthless and uncalled ior; worthless, because it involves
the gratuitous assumption that Tacitus was prevented from publishing the
treatise in the reign 01 Titus, and isso, that he issued this work 01 1110 youth in
the reign 01 Traian, when wholly occupied with historical composition. Itis
uncalled ior, because the difficulties which gave 11 birth, do not exist, as we
shall see.

²¹ The praenomen Publius, given by the cod. Mediceus, has been recently
confirmed by a Carian inscription (Bull. de Corresp. Hell. 1890 p. 621) 'Artemi
