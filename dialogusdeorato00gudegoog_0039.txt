That the Dialogus was published during the latter part of ⁷
Domitian's life has never been seriously maintained. Some
scholars, however (e. g. Vogel, Wolff), have thought it possible that
it may have been written as late as 85 s.1>., on the ground that the
despotic nature of Domitian had not yet manifested itself in these
earlier years of¹ his reign. This hypothesis is so clearly a mere
subterfuge resorted to for the purpose of escaping the alleged
difficulties found in the use of *iuvenis admodum* that we dismiss
it without further comment, especially as Vibius Crispus had
by that time been doubtless restored to imperial favor, if not to his
former power. ef. also Peter, Einl. p. 16.

But we may, as already intimated, go one step further, and show
that the Dialogus if written after the reign of Domitian, would
involve a literary anachronism, the subject with which it deals
being no longer a theme of discussion in the time of Nerva and
Trajan. If so, the reign of Titus will remain as the only possible
period for the composition of our treatise, be its author Tacitus or
any one else! As this important argument seems not to have been
advanced hitherto, Ι feel justified in discussing it more at length.

In scanning the pages of literary history we repeatedly meet
with certain controversies which seem to arise suddenly, one knows
not whence3 gradually they seiae upon the minds of literary men,
and a battle is waged for some time between opposing factions.
The ultimate outcome is invariably the restitution of the ‘status
quo' 3 no side ever gains a decisive victory. First a cessation of
hostilities ensues‚ atruoe is declared, a reconciliation effected or a
compromise made. The issue is then forgotten. Only now and
then in literary records do we seem to hear a faint echo as of
distant thunder, reminding one of the struggle of long ago. Other
questions have succeeded and pass through the same stages of
growth, culmination aad oblivion. We may illustrate this by a
number of concrete examples. ln the days of the Sophists and
Plato, we have the question whether things are νόμῳ or φύσει.
During the two and a half centuries before our era, the discussion
raged hercely as to whether anomaly or analogy was the domiuaut
factor in language formation. In the age of Cicera, Dionysius aud

Caecilius we have the controversy concerning the respective merits
of the Atticum and Asianum genus dicendi. At the closo of
Quintilian's life, it had become a dead issue. In the Middle AgeS,
