o. 14. 1v1

simis audientibus From these and numerous other passages in
Quint. aud Seneca, it follows that Andresen, John, Wolff and others
are wrong in identifying ‘declamatorium studium’ with ‘arcana
semotae dictionis’ in c. 2. For in that case, we should also expect
the phrase to have been transferred to the 'sed etiarn ' clause, since
*uon forensibus tanturn negotiis (real cases) et decl. stud) (extra
judicial pleadings) are clearly contrasted with the ‘disputatio’ of
Aper aad Maternus, interrupted by the entrance of Messalla.-
uon· · · anum is, in Tac, with but two exceptionS, always separated
by au intervening word. Cf. c. 22 17 Ag. 45 G. 35 Η. Ι 15. 35 Α55.
ΙΙΙ 33 XV 45 XVI 2 and XIII 20 non tanturn ruatrem Plautumque
XIV 55 qui me nou tantum praevisa sed subita, where rhetorical
reasons may have caused the irregular collocaticn. Cp. notes c.

18 ingenium alunt: A Ciceronian phrase. cf. Brut. 33, 126
alere ing. potest ex Cic. Ep. apud Suet. de cl. rhet. 2: existimabant
Graecis exercitationibus ali melius ingenia posse Quint. 18, 8 Π

c. 5 u—cum-tum: See c. 5 o.

20 pervenerint: The subjunctive in a conditional relative clause
expressing repeated action occasionall y occurs iu Cicero, but always
iu the perfect as here. The suhj. proterite iu such constructions is
not found before the time of Livy. Cp. Dr. H. S. 115405· Stil
p. 66 Madvig L. G. ξ 359, Furneaux‚ann.1utr0u. 1 p. 47. —The
inconcinnity observable iu the interchange of ruoods (qui. . .
adferunt' aud ‘ad quorurn . . . pervenerint ⁵) is quite characteristic
of Tacitus. ef.Ann.1 44 adprobaverat.. ,obiectavissent vl 18
habuisset . . . tribuerat, where see Nipp. and Furueaux. The refer·
ence is, of course, to outsiders, as in c. 32 31 quos si forte audierint,
but John unaccountably cites this passage in support of the very
opposite interpretation Ξ These phrases, it nray 59 observed, uuruis-
talrably indicate that the Dialogus is not the faithful reproduction
of an actual debate, as alleged, although it may possibly, like the
similar works of Cicero, be ultimately based upon some historical
occurrence. See Prolegomena p. lxxx note 17 9.

Livy and later writers Cp. R. V. III p. 293 f. Neue, Fornacal.
