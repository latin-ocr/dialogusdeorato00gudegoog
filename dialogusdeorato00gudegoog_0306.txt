c. 13. 159

12 sd quorum exempla me voees: cf. c. 8. For the phraseos.
Plin. Ep. IX 2,2 ad cuius (sc. Ciceronis) exemplum uos vocas
Paneg. 58 non te ad exemplar eius voco Cio. Acad· Pr. 18, 56 me
ad Democritum vocas—habent· - · concupiscendum: ‘What do
they possess that one might covet?' Different from the construo
tion 01 ‘habere' with the gerundive, discussed c. 812. ‘Concupiscen-
dum' here takes the place 01 the missing adjective ‘concupiscibilis’

13 quod timent arr quod timentur: an ‘or perhaps! Usage 111 sirni-
lar interrogative clauses leads us to expect ‘aut’ (R. V. III p. 313
10104421) but ‘an,’ as a disjunctive particle, is, according to Nip
perdey's observation (Ann. I 13), more common 111 Tacitus than in
any other writer. Cp. Heraeus ad H. Iv'Gautrelle, style de Tac.
5134. The same contrast is brought out in Tac. H. IV 42 nihil
quod ex te concupisceret, nihil quod timeret and in Sidon. Apoll.
Ep. V 1 (a locus classicus on informers) hi sunt quos timent, etiam
qui timentur.

14 11 quibus 11011 praestant indignantur: As Marcellus and Cris-
pus are importuned for favors day after day (cotidie), they would
naturally find it impossible, even 11 willing, to grant all requests
made to them, aud hence they necessarily incurred the hatred of
those who remained unnoticed. Cf. the quite similar statement
in Plut. Comp. Ale. et Coriol. 235 C: οὗ γὰρ θεραπεύουσι τοὺς πολλοὺς

de μὴ δεόμενοι τιμῆς, εἶτα χαλεπαίνουσι μὴ τυγχάνοντες . . .
ὥς τὸ χαλεπαίνειν μάλιστα μὴ τυγχάνοντα τῆς τιμῆς ἔκ τοῦ σφόδρα phi-
χεσθαι φυόμενον.

Lipsius‘ easy emendation has been uniiorrnly reiected. 01 those who
defend the MS. reading, some (e. g. Wolff) suppose 11 possible that the
author designediy introduced a paradox as a supernumerarius, who
naturally expects a negative statement, others, lilre John, contenti that
the emphasis is on ‘indignantun’ but in that cese some such reading as
Michaelis suggested would be necessary, which, however, is itseli open to
palaeographical obiectione. Andresen, followed by Peter, conjectures ‘vel ii
quibus praestant indignantur,’ a sentiment more epigrammatic than true, ss
isclear 110111 Andreseu’s own translation ι111101(111111ιί111,(1111011 sie ihre
Bitteu gewdhren, sich heleidipt fdhlen‘! ln all the passages, moreover, cited
by these scholars 111 support 01 this view (Tac. Aun. IV 18 Seu. Ep. 8, 32
Florus 11111 to which might have been added Tac. li. IV ds Sen. de ben.
13,1 1140, 1 sp. 19, 11), it is invariabiy the expected repayment 01 an
obligatior incurred that is said to render the giit irksome to the recipient
But this ideais not expressed iu our passage nor do the words 01 the text
lend themselves to such sn interpretation.
