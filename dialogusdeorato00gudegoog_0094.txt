oratory in republican Rome were operative in producing a similar
phenomenon in democratia Athens. To attempt to go beyond this
is to leave the terra firma of fact for the limitless regions of con·

mem amum sonans OF THE unrocus.

The Dialogus de oratoribus purports to be, as we have seen, the ⁷⁷³⁰. ρίαὶοριω
faithful reproduction from memory of a debate which the young smum
Tacitus had been privileged to listen t0, and which, about seven
years later, after the death of the noted interlocutors, still seemed
to him of sufficient interest and positive value to merit the atten-
tion ol posterity.

The great majority of editors and critics, with the solitary
exception of Kleiber and Rausch,¹²³ tacitly assume that the author’s
explanation of the origin of the treatise was given in good faith, a
few only venturing far enough to concede at least the bare pos·
sibility that the debate in question may be in reality essentially
unhistorical. The above-mentioned scholare dealt with this subject '
only incidentally‚ and neglected many clear indications of the
correctness of their view. The following remarks will therefore
not be out ol place.

The Dialogus, we coutend‚ is a treatise cast into the dramatic
formos a debate by its author for the same reasons that prompted
Plato or Cicero to choose this particular species oi literary com·
position. For it, and it alone, enabled them thoroughly to discuss
asubject from all points of view, without ex cathedra utterances or .
dogmatic exposition. The grounds which compel me to look upon
the Dialogus in this light are briefly as follows:

(1) There is no instance of a similar work in any literature
which can be regarded as strictly historical. ln all dialogical com·
position the author invariably exercises the right of the creative
artist to invent his characters and to place them in such situations,
as may be best conducive to the accomplishment of his object, but,
being an artist, he also endeavors to impart an air of verisimilitudo

to his creatiou by giving a kind of pictorial reality to the scenery
