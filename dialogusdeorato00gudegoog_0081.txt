expressly indicated¹⁶¹ in the Dialogue‚ but clearly implied in the

significant omission of his ancestor in c. 25 15 ff. This extremely
meagre information can happily be considerahly augmented from
Tacitus himself.

Messalla was born about last· 1. m, for in the year 70 he had not
yet reached the senatorial age, which had been fixed by Augustus
at 25.¹⁶² In the war between Vitellius and Vespasian (69 am),
he was tribune of the seventh or Claudian legion, which formed
part of the Moesian army, and subsequently joined the forces ol
Antonius Primus, then stationed at Hostilia, near Verona, taking
part in the second battle of Bedriacum and at the siege of
Cremona.1¹⁵³ After his return to Rome, he seems tc have written
historical mernoirs describing, with the accuracy of au eye-witness,
tlre chief events of the war, a work which Tacitus utilised as a
secondary source for his narrative of this period.¹⁵⁴

Like the rest of the interlocutors, he was probably no longer
living in the reign of Titu8,¹⁶⁶ and he does not appear in Pliuy’s
correspondenoe. The high conrpliments which Tacitus, in the
Histories, pays tc his character aud his oratorioal accomplishments
coincide so perfectly with what is said cf biru and what he is made
to say in the earlier treatise, that we cannot but recoguise in this

¹⁶¹ For ‘Maiores tuos' has been misinterpreted to mean ‘Your ancestor.’

the cognomen is exceedingly common-who was consul with one M. Pedo
Vergilianus in llb 1. n, though advocatcl by the great majority oi scholam,
