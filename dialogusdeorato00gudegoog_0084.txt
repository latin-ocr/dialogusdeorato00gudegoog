cannot be assigned to one single speaker, be his name Messalla,
Secundus or Maternus, because of the heterogeneous character of
their consents.¹⁸¹

Another theory was advanced by Heumann, who contended that
a lacuna must be assumed after the words ‘faces admovebant,'
because of the want of any orgauic connection with what follows.
The words cited he regarded as the close of Messalla’s argument,
while the remainder was assigned to Maternus. This view did not
find a champion till Becker¹⁶² strongly advocated it a century later,
with the modification, however, that he too assumed the preceding
speaker to have been Secundus, his grounds being similar to those
advanced by Steiner. But this explanation was also neglected or
rejected, until Andrean, fifty years still later, again returned to the
original hypothesis of Heumann,¹⁶⁸ adding, what his predecessore
had failed to dc, a few passages as evidence of the contradictory
character between the two parts. Finally the whole question was
taken up anew by Habeam who in turn argues in favor oi Becker’s
solution of the problem.

The great majority of editors and critice, however, obstinately
hold to the view that everything from c. 36 to 42 was spoken by
Maternus, some of these clinging to the belief that Secundus did
not speak at all,¹⁶⁶ while others maintaiu that he did sc, but that
his contribution to the debete, together with the close of Messalla's
argument and the beginning of Maternus', was lost in the lacuna,1⁶⁶
which they in consequence assume to be one of considerable
magnitude.

¹⁶¹ When Steiner also argues that Fontanus (the cod. B is the apographon ol
his copy, now lost) leit the middle oi p. 30· and the whole of p. 30¹³ vacant, in
the hope that the lost speech oi Maternus might some day turn up, his prejudices
allowed him to terget that it such had been Pontanus’ metire, we should, to
say the least, have expected some space to have been left vacant aster the word
‘matun' and not merely at the close of the entire treatise 1 Cp. also Baehrens
