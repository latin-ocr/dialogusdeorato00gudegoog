Demosthene accepimus, ea aetate L. Crassus ostendit id se in
foro optume iam facere, quod etiam tum poterat domi cunr laude
meditari. The defendant, C. Papirius Carbo (see c. 18 3), corn-

mitted suicide before sentence was pronounced upon him (Cic. ad
fam. IX 21, ⁴3 Brut. 27 , 103 Vel. hlax. ΙΙΙ 7, 6).

posita seditione civili (1.0. M. Aemilio Lepido D. lunio Bruto coss

77 rr'. c. cf. O. Ι. L. I p. 439 Brut. 92, 317 1.) Cornel. Dolabellam
consularem et triumphalem repetundarum postulavit. This speech ·

(mentioned also by Ascon. in Scaur. p. 26 Or. Vell. Pat. ll 43 Plut.
Caes. 4) established Caesar⁷s oratorical reputation. cf. Suet. Caes
55 post accusationem Dolabellae haud dubie principibus patronis
adnumeratus est.

The MSS. all have 0000 deamo . . . L. Crassus 010, which date, as
Lambinus and Brotier pointed out, conflicts with the express testimony
01 Cic. l. o. Nipperdey, illicia. Mus. XIX 57711. (= Opusc. 323 11), has,
therefore, substitutcd 000 01 0100001010. That the trial 01 Carbo (sce also
note 0. 183) 10011010000100100000010111010 120 n. c. (C. I. L. 1 p. 534) is
clear from a comparison 01 Clade leg. lll 111, 35 and cle orat. 11 111, 1711,
and as Crassus (see Cic. Brut. 43, 1111) was born in 140 a. 0., 11 follows that
he was 001 01001000 but troeatpone years 01 age in lli) a. c. -In the second
date the MSS. are again 01 variance with the facts, 00 casaubonus and
Lipsius observed, ior according 1ο the unimpeachable testimony 0180010-
nius l. c., Caesar (born July 13, 10(1; see violantes) must have bccn 01
least 23, not 21 years old, when he accused Dolabella. There 000, there-

fore, be no doubt that the dates given 10 our MSS. involve two chrono· ’

logical errors, but the propriety or justification 01 emending the text ac·
cordiugly, must be very seriously questioned, ior apert from the intrinsic
improbability 01 two palpable errors in the MSS, the corrections proposed
destroy the chronological sequence (19-21-22-24) evidently designed by
the author. Under those circumstances, we are forced 10 the conclusion
that the dates here given are due 10 Tacitus or rather to the source which
he consulted. This is rendered the ruore plausible, us the chronological
data concerning the speeches 01 1001000 orators seem to have been 01 0

a relative of Cato Uticensis, was tribunus plebis in 56 and accused
