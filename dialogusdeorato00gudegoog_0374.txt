neuter, not masc. (sc. oratoribus), as Peter contends, for (1) the
sccalled ia ‘de scriptore’ does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus.
(2) Even if it did, consistent usage would here require 'apud,' inas-
much as Aper does not include the entire works of the ancient
oratore in his otherwise sweeping condemnation, but expressly
exempta some of the speeches ol Calvus. Cp. note 0. 9 a.

not meant to apply merely to obscure third or fourthclass orators,
whose desiccated style nevertheless found supporters, but to the
most eminent as well. Uarum dc populo, like τῶν ἐκ τοῦ πολλοῦ δήμου

(quoted below) in much stronger language called the dregs of
eloquence. What little we know of the orators here presumably
stigrnatised, for the names themselves 010 corrupted, has been
collected and exhaustively discussed by Nipperdey, Ra. 111110. XIX
