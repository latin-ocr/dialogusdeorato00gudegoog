11 12, 38 verbi (verborum) controversia—tamquam, introduces
the opinion of another, asin c 2 2, where see note.

4 centum annos: Messalla curtly dismisses Aper’s chronological
argument as irrelevant and is hence free to usea round number,
even though it may seem to favor his 01101111110011111101,111
still further narrowing down the short interval that has elapsed
between the so called ‘antiqui' and his own time.

5 dc vocabulo pugna: Similar military metaphora are frequent.
Cf. e. g. 010. (11 fin. II 13, 42 Stoicis quibuscum bellum gerebat
(sc. Carneades) dediv.1151,105 Quint. X 1, 105 quantam mihi
concitem pugnam.

6 quo 1110 nominc: e. g. veteres, prisci, olim nati-dum modo
occurs in Tacitus only here and G. 6, ‘dum' taking 111 place in his
other writings.

7 in confesso: The same expression occurs c. 27 31111 frequently
elsewhere (see Dies). On these and similar prepositional phraseS,
cp. Dr. H. S. 155-59 Stil p. 36 Gerber Dc (1111111111. p. 11.-
emincntiorcm, used figuratively as in c. 1 2.

- 8 parti ‘passage.’—si cominus fatetur: This much disputed

passage seems to me perfectly iutelligible and unobjectionable in
expression. Si 101 the more regular ‘qua’ is sufficiently supported
by the many parallel constructione adduced by Vahlen, Prooem.

military metaphors immediately preceding, is somcwhat boldly
but appropriately here used 01 coming closer to the main point at
issue which Aper did, when he made the remark (c. 18 7 f.) which
Messalla approvingly repeata for the discussion which preceded
was, in the speaker's opinion, as we have seen, 101 germane 10 1111
subject. On a perfectly analogous use 01 'cominus' cf. Cic. (11

observes,a touch of sarcasm 11 these words, implying that Aper
had, with some flourish, adduced as an original discovery what was
