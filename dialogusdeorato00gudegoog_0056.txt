while the writer oi the Dialogus is ‘dulcis et candidus et iusus3 ille
vi [melior]‚ hic voluptate! And such, it is true, must be the super·
ficial impression which every readcr will carry away from a perusa]
of the historical works and the rhetorical treatise, but it is, never·
theless, a one-sided one, because superficial. A closer examination,
as the above coincidences, intentionally selected almost exclusively
from the Historias and Annals, must have made tolerably clear, on
the one hand utterly inriolulotcs the assertion of Lipsius and his
followers that the Annals and our treatise, published more than
thirty years previous, have absolutely no stylistio features iu com·
mon, while on the other, it as fully confirmo Lipsius' dictum ‘mutari
is (sc. stilus) in aetate aut argumento potest. . . sed numquam ita
ut abeat prorsus a sese!

But if we must needs admit that remarkable stylistio coincidences
exist side by side with equally remarkable stylistio divergencies,
all objections urged against Tacitean authorship, quite independent
of the weighty internal evidence already adduccd, will bc disposed
of, if we finally succeed in giving some plausible auswer to the
following questions: (1) How came Tacitus to write in the fluent,
exuberant, rhetorical style oi the Dialogue? (2) How came he to
abandon it for the nervous energy, the studied brevity, and the
succinctness of expression, thoughtladeu to the verge of obscurity,
so characteristic of the Annals?

We have seen that Tacitus enjoyed a thorough rhetorical training diaconion
preparatory to the forensic career which he had chosen. At the ‘lame‘
time when the future historiari began his studies, Quintilian h‘ad
already started out on his life-long crusade against the styliet
Seneca by preaching a return to the chaste and classic model of
oratorical excellence which he saw typified in Cicero. Now even
if it were not all but certain that the young Tacitus, like his friend
Pliny, had been a pupil of the great rhetorician, the treatise itself
would prove that its author had at all events come under his influ-
ence, for so far from reflecting the stylistio mannerisms of Seneca,
so much affected by the writers of the time, the Dialogus displays
not only a profound and extensive acquaintance with the works of
Cicero, as we shall see, but its very diction is saturated throughout
with Ciceronian phraseology. The documentary evidence of this
hasbeen collected in the Commentary, and the index locorum s. v.
Cicero will reveal at a glauce the great extent of the author's
