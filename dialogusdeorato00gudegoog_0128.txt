allowed to perish, a few copies having, however, been taken pre-
viously. It is upon two of these apographa, as Michaelis was 1110
first to show, that 001 MSS. are based. The first family (X) is
represented by the Vaticanus 1862 (Α) aud the Leidensis 18 (B).
The other (Y) comprises the Parnasianus 01 Neapolitanus (C), 1110
Vaticanus 1518 (D), the Ottobonianus 1455 (E), the Vaticanus
4498 (Δ) aud Vindobonensis 711 (V). Four others still remaining,
the Vindobouensis 351 (0000 the property 01 Sambucus, see note 4),
the Venetus 01 1101010000, the Parisinus 7773 and the Harleianus,
010 absolutely valueless, and may safely 110 dispensed with in any
recensio of the text of the Dialogus.⁹³²

We shall first give au account 01 the principal MSS, theu pass
on 10 0 consideration of the intricate and difficult subject 01 their
iuterrelationship, aud finally discuss the controversial question 01
the respective validity of the X and Y families.²⁰⁸

a. Description of the MSS.

1. The codex Vaticanus 1862 (A) contains the Germania and Vaticanus

Dialogus. The variants peculiar to this MS. arc ,nc

¹⁰⁷ Peterson in his recent edition has endeavored to rescue the Harleianus
(Η) 11010 what he regards 00 undeserved neglect. He devotes no iewer than six
peges (pp. lxxv-imi) to 110 history and 110 description, and religiously records
all its readings. But even a hasty examination 01 his evidence ought 10 10000
uo doubt in the mind 01 any unblassed critic, that the verdict 01 condemnatiou
which Michaelis and Baehrens have passed upon this MS. 10 fully justified.

the character 01 the MS. upon which the editio princeps (Spirensis) 0. g. was

therefore, very justly remarks (p. lxxvi) 1110111 ‘⁴ need not be referred to again
