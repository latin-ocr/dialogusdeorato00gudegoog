this interpretation seems to me, all things considered, to be the
more plausible-frigidissimos: ‘frigidus' Gk. ψυχρός, though ex·

eeedingly common as au epithet oi style (see e. g. Περὶ ὕψους 3, 3 f.)
is rarely applied to the writers themselves as e. g. Cic. ad Quint.
frat. ΙΙΙ 3,3 accusatoribus frigidis utitur Brut. 48,1i8 nimis lentus
in dicendo et paene frigidus. cf. also Arist. Aah. 138 εἰ μὴ κατένιψε

this disputed passage is this: Such is the inspiring influence oi
great trials‚ such the stimulating effect oi intenseiy interested
audientes, that even speakers of mediocre ability will in spite oi
themselves be impelled to higher efforts, and hence posterity bases
its opinion of the accused and its estimatiou of the accusers almost
exclusively upon the speeches delivered on these occasions, how-
ever acceptable in themselves other oratorical productioris of the
same speakers may have been.

than a striking, concrete illustration oi the truth oi the general statemenur
immediately preceding: ‘splendor reorum . . . et ipsa plurimum eloquentiae
praestant . . . crescit curn amplitudine rerum vis ingenii (c. 37 1821).
Andresen’s emendation, though ingenious, is consequently not called ior,
not to mention that ‘legerunt‘ in place oi ‘legunt’ is sufficient to invali-
date it. Cp. also lohnad loc.
