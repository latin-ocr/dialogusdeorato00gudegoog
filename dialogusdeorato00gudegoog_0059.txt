and is found iu tha indelible impress made upon the mind of
Tacitus by the horrors of the reign of Domitian, for according to
Buffon’s famous phrase, “le stylo est de l'homme meme,'' and so
Goethe says “ Im Ganzen ist der Stil eines Schriftstellers ein
treuer Abdruck seines Inneren.’' But if the maa Tacitus neccs-
sarily revealed himself in the stylist Tacitus, it was as natural that
the buoyant optimism of his youth should revel in tho exuberanco

of diction which characterises the Dialogue, as that a brief, suc-
cinet, nervous, and energetic style should become the fit vehicla of
expression for the feelings of intense indignation which had taken
possession of Tacitus when, after the death of Domitian, he deter-
mined to devote himself to historical composition.

Still another reason for the change under discussion is the differ·
ence oi the auffert-matter itself. A speech, a history, a dialogue or
aletter call for distinctly different stylistio treatment, at least in
the hands of an ancient writer, for Latin, as well as Greek, though
perhaps in an inferior degree, by reason of an incomparablc flex-
ibility of structure and clasticity of form, can bc made to reproduce,
like a musical instrument, characteristic features of thought and
feeling. ln fact, it is only in music that we can find a modern
analogue to this unrivaled versatility of expression of Greek and
Latin, modern languages being far more rigid, less plastic and more
devoid oi stylistic freedom. Hence we find the various species of
literary composition in the classic tongues conforming to particular
types or genera dicendi peculiarly adapted to the thought which
they are designed to embody,¹⁰⁰ and the numerous ancient systems
of rhetoric, which to modern notions seem so often only the result

laetum, numerosum et aequabile dicendi genus, quo iuvenis viguerat, sicut con-
tinuis imbribus vexata et prostrata seges non ad priorem integrum laetumque
florem resurgit, oum praesertim uberes iam et frequentes spicas conceperit.
Animo eius concusso, cx acerbato, indignato talis sermo non amplius conveni·
ebat; uti potuit oratione non iere alia,quan1 qua usus est, brevi et nervosa,
interdum aspera et acerba. Sive igitur Taciti in scribendo consilium sive animi
eius immutationem respicimus, saevo Domitiani imperio effectam facetosum
non potuisse videmus, quin in historicis suis scriptis componendis uteretur
sermone a dialogi stilo prorsus alieno.

Μ It is this mechanical clement which alone explains the successful perpetra-
tion in antiquity oi such literary frauda as that oi Anaximenes’ Τρικάρανος or
the numerous apocryphal writings oi Lysias, Demosthenes, etc, no less than tho
stylistic parodies oi Plato. See Classical studies in Honor of Henry Drisler
laos, ‘Literary Fraude among the Greeks)
