26 neo bene famam eloquentiae dicero teli exitu pensavit: Cicero
dearly bought his oratorical reputation by the wretched death he
suffered in consequence. cf. Seu. de remed. fort. 12, 4 Η. si muti

issent Ps. Quint. Deci. 268 quid ego dicam quantum civitati profu-

(sc. Dem. et Cic.) perit orator . . . nec umquam Ι sanguine causidici
maduerunt rostra pusilli. Secundus had admitted in c. 37 ltff. that
the superior eloquence of the ancients was but a poor compensation
for the anarchical conditions which alone had rendered its growth
possible. This is true, rejoins Maternus, but it should also be
added, that not even these orators themselves were allowed to enjcy
the fruits of their reputation‚ for thcy all met with a violentend.

Maternus had occupied himself (c. 40) with an examinatlon of the argu-
ments of Secundus, which he had drawn from the political conditions of
the Republic (o. :tc-tt ext). Beginning with c. 38, Secundus discussed the
constitution of the law-courts. Accordingly Maternus, following the same
order of topice, proceeds with a consideration of the statements iu this
second part of Secundus‘ speech. This symmetrically elaborated antithesis
and the constant polemical allusione to subjecta touched upon in c. 33 (see
the following notes) are, in my judgment, absolutely inexplicable on the
theory that Maternus was the speaker throughout. Cp. Proleg. p. lxxx 11. ,

answer to the words of Secundus c. 36511. horum quoque tempo·

to c. 3810 omnia in foro . . . quod maius argumentum est etc.
What little of forensic pleading, Maternus replies, still remains to
modern oratore, for causae centumvirales, as we have just been
told, now hold the first place (c. 3811) and are tried in ‘auditoria' q
