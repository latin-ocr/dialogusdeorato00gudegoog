numerous emendations proposed as an unnecessary tampering with the
text. Cp. Andresen, Emend. p. 148-150 John, Correspbl. p. 211 1.-1011.
Mulier, followed by Wolff and andresen, ingeniously conjectured ‘qua
quasi corninus uisus' on the analogy of Tac. Aun. 1v 51 adversum resi-
stentis cominus niti fatetur. But ‘qua’ for ‘si' ls not called for, as has
been shown, nor is ‘quasi‘ needed, for Tacitus and other post-Augrmtan
writers ireely dispeme with apologico for unusual metaphora See E.
Wolff, Einleit. p. 14 1. ‘nisus' is also superfluous, 1011 cannot see why
‘cominus' may not have the meaning which was given to it above. Fiually,
it is intrinslcally improbable that three words were omitted lu the MSS.
Nissen's easy emendation ‘comminans' revived by Vahlen, is, in my judg-
ment out of place, as 1 am unable to recognise any threci in the words of
Aper in c. 18 7 agere enIm fortius lam et audentius volo.

the Dialogus though exceedingly common iu the other writings 01
Tacitus See Lex. Tac. p. satietas It seems to occur first in
the Bell. Afric. cp. 1110111171 91 and in general, Schmalz, Anto.

habitually grouped together as marking the zenith 01 01011001 great·

Nepot. de vita cleric. : Demosthenes tibi (sc. Ciceroni) praeripuit,
ue esses primus orator, tu illi nc solus. — Aeschines 01 Hyperides
01 Lysias 01 Lyeurgus: The names of the Greek, as well 00 those
of the Roman orators, enumerated immediately below, are not
arranged chronologically, but in the order 01 merit. Quint. X 1, 's’ 6
agrees with this critical estimate: Decem (sc. oratores) simul Athe· ·

mentioned throughout the entire Institutio.

The editors oi the Dial. have with singular unanimlty rejected ‘autem'
before ‘locum’ lt is, however, eminently proper in this place, as shown
by the succeeding symmetrically constructed clause: Cicero ... Calvus
autem. lt is the second ‘autem’ that ought to have been objected to, and
Ifeel convincecl that the original reading was ‘tamem' The corruption
