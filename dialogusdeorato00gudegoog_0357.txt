Senatus consurrexit et prosequebatur Catonem in carcerem. Hac
invidia facta, Caesar destitit et mitti Catonem iussit! The first
attempt at ‘closure' with a view to checking this abuse was made

- by the lex Pompeia de vi et ambitu (52 Β. 0.), mentioned c. 38 0,

where see note. Cp. Mommsen, Ro'm. Stoatsr. 111 919. 934. 985
Lange, 1101110001. ΙΙ 384. 452. —By these long-winded speeches
we can strictly, it would seem, understand only those delivered in
the ‘comitia’ for, if we include the senate, ‘popa ut imperitus’ is out

’ 01 place, if the law courts, ‘diem dicendo eximere' is inapplicable,

because the time allotted to speakers in a judicial trial was appar·
ently limited by the clepsydra, at least as far back as 7 0 s. c. (Cic.
Verr. 19, 25 legitimae horae). Cp. Marquardt, Privatleh. 37011.
Smith, Dict. Aret. I 775. On the other hand, it is not probable that
Aper’e remark should, for no apparent reason, have been inten-
tionally confined to the oratore in the comitia. We must, therefore,
add this passage to the examples of inconsistency enumerated in
c. 3 20.-Ecimcrct and videretur (below) in the protasis, the apo
dosis being usually in the imperf. indicative, are subjunctivae of
indefinite frequency. This construction is extremely rare in pre·
Aug. prose. In Cicero only de orat. 1 54, 232 eratenim Athenis
reo damnato, si fraus capitalis non esset, quasi poenae aestimatio,
but here Sorof, followed by Wilkins, assume an oratio obliqua.
There 10 an indisputable instance, however, in Caes. B. G. V 35
sin . . . tenere vellent. . . relinquebatur, and Livy furnishes a
number of examples. 111 Silver Latin, finally, this socelled itera
tive subj. 10 most frequent in Suetonius and quite common 111 Taci-
tus. cf.H.1491151V1Ann.1157111691vv.4sv11vl
30 XV 45. Cp. Dr. H. S. 11733 Stil p. 77 1. (who omits our pas·
sago), Hoffmann, Zeilpartr'keln p. 52 ff. - longa principiorum prse-
paratio: praeparatio, προπαρασκευή, 10 a technical term referring 10
the attempts 01 an orator to render his hearers or the judge favor·
ably disposed toward him attho outset. cf. Quint. IV 1, 1 (cited
below) 72, 2, 26. Aper does not condemn 11110 practice, audit
is expressly recommended hy Quint. (cf. IV2 V111o,121X2,17
etc), but he objeets to what seem to him excessively long intro·
ductione of this kind, tolerated by the audiences of the Republic.
cf. Quint. IV 1, 62 nec minus evitanda est immodica eius (prin-
cipii) lmryitudc ne in caput excrevisse videatur et quo praeparare
debet, fatiget. -Lonyo for ‘longorum' by hypallage. Cf. note c. 2 3.
