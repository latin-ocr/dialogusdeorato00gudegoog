the later writings, probably under Virgilian influence, Τ. develops
an increasing fondness for the more emphatic forms, such as ingens,
inmensum, imuanis and the like. In the Dial. ‘ingens’ occurs again

11 voluptas spectaro: Abstract substantivas are 01100 used as
the predicates 01011 infinitivo. voluptas c. inf. is found, 0. g. in
Prop. Ι 10, 3 meminisse mihi iucunda voluptas. Ov. Heroid. XII

substantival Infinitive, cp. Woelfflin, Archiv pp. II 1001.- homines

Tac. dnn. 112. 43111 31, but it is generally used in the sense 01
vetustus, 01 one who has gained ripe experience by length 01 service
in the army, for instance. cf. H. I 23 Ann. XI 25 and hence sorne
commentators translate veteres et senes 'old and experienced men,’
thus doing away with the tautology. The tendency 01 both Greek
and Romans, however, to group words like veteres, antiqui, prisci
together (01. 11010 c. 15 1) and expressions, such as we find in Ter.
Eun. IV 4, 21 vietus, vetus veternosus senex and Tibull. 18, 50:
In veteres esto dura, puella, senes make 11 01 least doubtful, whether
such distinctions were more than vaguely felt, for the best and most
careful writers often use these words without any appreciable differ·
enee 01 meaning. Peter's interpretation 01 ‘homines veteres’ as the
counterpart 01 'homines novi’ is unsupported by actual usage. He
leaves us the alternative of accepting this ἅπ. dp. or 01 banishing
‘veteres' from the text, but its deletion necessarily draws that 01
homines with it l How a scribe ever carue to hit upon the unfortu-
nate interpolation 01 1010100, Ρο101 also forgets to tell us. On the
synonymic character 01 the worda, a much disputed question, cp.
