explained. Nipperdey Bt. Mus. XIX all-277, prefers to change the llrst ‘sive’
into ‘vel,' but his contentiori that ‘in senatu' and ‘apud principem’ belong
closely together is quite grouudless. Ican recognlse only two members‚

vel and sive having accidentally changed places. ‘Sive in iudicio vel lu ’

senatu' form the one (often combbred by Cicero), ‘sive apud principem,’ the
new judicial tribunal unknown to the Roman republic, the other. Cf. Tac.
Anu. XIV 7 sive servitia armaret vel militem accenderet sive ad senatum et
populum pervaderet. c. 28 a aut tibi ipsi aut huic Secundo vel huic Apro,
with note. This interpretation derives weighty support from the change oi
ibe preposition (iu-in-apud), ior had T. intended a mere enumeration‚ hc
would probably have written sivo (vel) apud iudicem (or centumviros) sive
(vel) apud patres sive (vel) apud principem. See c. i s f.

30 Eprius Marcellus: His full name and the principal offices
which he held are given iu an inscription from Capua, his probable
birthplace. C. I. L. X 3853: Τ. Clodio, M. f. Pal(atina sc.
tribu), Eprio Marcello cos. 11 (61 and 74 A. m), auguri, curioni
maximo, sodali Augustali pr(aetori) per(egrino) procos Asiae III
(to-73 A. u.) provincia Cypros. A notorious informer (under
Nero) and a powerful friend oi Vespasian (cf. c. 8) he, for reasons
unknown to us, conspired against the emperor and was driven to
suicide in 79 A. n. (cf. Cass. Dio 66, 16). Of the three encounters
with Helvidius Priscus (cf. H. IV 6, 5. 6 10-9. 43.) the third
(c. 70 A. n.) is undoubtedly the one here alluded to, not the secerni,
as is shown hythe terms nuper. . intestibus patribus. . minax. .
elusit, none oi which is applicable to the (lebate between Hel-
vidius and Marcellus so vividly slretched by Tacitus H. IV 6 10-9,
but they unmistakably refer to the last unsuccessful attempt oi
Helvidius to crush his old enemy. cf. Tac. Η, IV 43 Tanto cum
adsensu senatus auditus est Montanus ut spem caperet Helvidius
posse etiam Marcellum prosterni. . . crimine simul exemploque
Eprium urguebat, ardentt'lms patrum animis (=infestis patribus)
quod ubi sensit Marcellus: ‘imus’ inquit‚‘P1·isce, et relinquimus
tibi senatum tuum: regna praesente caesare! sequebatur Vibius
Priscus, ambo infensi, vultu diverso, Marcellus rninocdms oculis,

Crispus renidens . . . consumptus per discordiam dies, ’1161111-
acter given to Marcellus, the tribute paid to his eloquence, both
here and more fully c. 8 and 13 11 ff, are iu perfect accord with
the references to him found in the historical writings of Tacitus,
even down to the epithet ‘minax’ (H. l. c. Arm. XVI 29). On the
importance of this coincidence in determiuing the author of the
Dialogus, see Prolegomena p. xliii i.
