14 enutrias quidem 0101010.; Translate: ‘Though the ‘suaso-
riae? it 10 1110, 010 given over 10 hoya, owing to a belief (nunqnam)
that they are more elementary and require less skill, the ‘contro-
versiae’ are assigned to the more mature—good heavens! what
011111 they are made of, how contrary to actual happenings they are
concoctedl' Tacitus nreans to say that the themes 01 suasoriae
are bad enough, but being confined, from a mistaken notion 01
their character, toa lower grade 01 instruction, they possibly work
less havoc than the equally objectionable controversiae, whose per·
nicious influence naturally strikes a deeper and firmer root in
minda that are more mature, and thus incapacitates them for the
10101010 001001, upon which they are so soon to enter.

The editors 01 the Dial. have with astonishing unanimity deleted ‘etsi,’
iound in all the MSS, without even attempting 10 explain the origin 01 the
alleged corruption. The objection to ‘etsi' seems 10 be based upon the
assumption that ‘suasoriae' and ‘controversiae' are 0001100100. Βο1 thia
isnot the case, aa Vahlen, Prooenr. Berol. 1881 p. 81, was the 1110110 point
out. “Tacitus nolnit suasorias et controversias part iugo coniungere, sed
hoc dicit, in suasoriis quidem, etsi minus damnum 011, quia minoribus
attribuantur, controversias plus nocere, in quibus robustiorum ingenia con-
tundantur et hebescent.⁷’ See also John ad loc. Andrcsen's note involves
a petitio principii. He remarks that, “ where ‘quidem’ serves like pla to
introduce 0001111101, the second member is either followed by ‘antem' (δέ),
as in c. 811 1810 11) 14, 01 1110 adversative particle is omitted‚” ior which
ellipsis he cites—the present passage! To my mind, this exception clearly
proves that ao contrast is here intended. “Ι1, 11011011·1,” 110 continues,
“quidem has a concessive 10100 (which it unquestionably has 11010), 11 10
either followed by ‘tamen' as in c. 010 01 by ‘sed' asin e. 531 80.” This
is but partially true, 101 101 only 10 the ellipsis 01 adversative particlcs very
common in Tacitus (sec the cxx. cited in 1101001110) but instaures 01 the
omission 01 ‘sed’ aiter a roveceastre ‘quidem' are particularly frequent!
