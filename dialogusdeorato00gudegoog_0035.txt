the Tacitean authorship altogether or oi accepting the psychological
impossibility that one and the same writer at one and the same
time was capable of employing two kinds of style, so different as
that employed in the Dialogus and in the Agricola and Germania.

The πρῶτον ψεῦδος in this seemingly cogent and logical argumen-
tation is the utterly nnwarranted assertion that the quaestor P.
Cornelius Tacitus, who at the early age of 23J24 had become the
son-in-law of the consul Agricola, then in the zenith of his fame,
could not have designated himself as ‘iuvenis admodum' in refer·
enee to the time, when he at the age oi rosal was pursuing his
studies under the guidance of Aper and Secundus! The indis-
putable fact has, moreover, often been pointed out that in no other
period oi a man’s life will even a few years work greater changes
than in the interval between youth and early manlrood, and ii this
is the case with men oi average intellectual endowment, how much
more true must it have been in a man of genius, such as Tacitus
admittedly was. That the greatest Roman lristorian received a
most thorough rhetorIcal trainIng, that he acquired high distinction
as an orator at an early age are facts denied by no one,³⁸ and ii any
doubt as to his precocity still remained, it would be dispelled by the

following famous and often cited letter oi Pliny (V1120,3): erit
rarum et insigne duos homines aetate et dignitate propemodum
aequales nonnullius In litteris nominis alterurn alterius studia
fovisse, equidem adaclescentalus (Pliny was born 62 a. n.) curn iam
tu sama gloriaque floreres, te sequi, tibi longo sed proximo inter·
vallo et esse et haberi concupiscebam. et erunt multa clarissima

ausgebildet.’ It in also worthy oi notice that Andresen in his last editi0n, and
in his revision of NIpperdey’s Annals, tacitly omits all reference to the alleged
¹ execution of Maternus in 91 a. o. and the inference based upon it that the
Dialogus was a kind of In Memoriam tribute! See esp. his Tac. oia Schultectiire
p. 322 f. Tlris latter view is well, though superfluonsly, refuted by WeInkanff
p. LVIII.

⁸⁸ Cp. Iickstein p. ’10 if. Haase p. VII f. XVI. LI. 'Ihat Tacitus, like his
friend Pliny, enjoyed the Instruction of Quintilian ishighly probable (cf. e. g.
Liebert, de doctrina Tac. p. 4 in), in spite of Wutk's contention to the contrary
(p. xl ff.): ‘Cur ei (se. Quintiliano) operam navaret Tacitus, vigInti lam auno-
rum iuvenis, quem tum vel brevi pqst ad causas agendas animum convertisse
conato (11)- et cur ad Quintssianum se conferret, cum Messallam, quern arcta
familiaritate complexus esse videtur (II. 11111 IV 42), sequi posset, qui similia
atque ille sentiretill HIs other arguments are of an equally convineing
character.
