14 memoria et recordatione ‘vivid recollection.' This colloca·
tion is common (e. g. Cic. de orat. I 53, 228 Brut. 151555. V 31,
88) and the tautology only apparent, 151 memoria is the generis
term denoting merely the power by which we are enabled to repro-
duoe impressions. Quint. XI 2, 43 recordatio firmissima memoriae
pars, hence Cic. de orat. ιΙ 2, 4 555 say memoriae recordatio. Cp.
Seyii. Moli. Laelius p. 555 and the interesting passage in Plut Cat.
Min. 1. So in Greek μνήμη and ἀνάμνησις.

Tacitean usage calls 151 ‘e-excepi' in place oi the MS. reading ι5551551,’
as has been shown at length in Aoo Jour. Phil. 1111351. The same scribsi
error is found e. g. 15 oh. 2 10 and in Quint. X l, 86.

16 singuli 515. : A much disputed and generally misinterpreted
passage. It will be admitted that ‘formam sui quisque et animi et
ingenii redderent’ is intended by the author to apply to all the
interlocutom, but this necessitates the further inference that Aper
is included among the singuli. Ι1 55, we cannot properly supply
corruptae eloquentiae after causas, for Aper vehemently denies
the very proposition. Andreseu’s explanation that, as far as Aper
is concerned, ‘der Begriff des Verfalls der Beredsamkeit zu dem der
Verhndorung erweitert wird’ involves a kind 51 zeugma which
caunot be accepted without parallel instaures. This difficulty is
avoided hy supplying some such expression as ‘immutatae eloquen-
tiae) On this point all the speakers are agreed. 'Diversas' has
the meaning 51 ‘various’ not ‘opposite' (mit Rdcksicht 551 Apers
Starulpunkt, Andresen), for Aper's attitude is not made known till
the end 51 1115 chapter. The reader so far naturally supposes that
the various speakers endeavored, each in his own way, to give the
reasons why the present age produced no real orator. This per·
fectly legitimate inference the author forthwith correcta by adding
that such unaninrity did not exist among those who took 5511 15
1115 (lebate ‘for there was also one present, who, as Ι would have
you know, took quite the opposite side’ etc. In all the interpreter
tions hitherto proposed this peculiar 15155 51 511115 (51. 5. 5 ⁴3
