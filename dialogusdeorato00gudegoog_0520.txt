o. 40. 373

cf. c. 19 ext. 39 roa—tulit sine dubio valentiorem eloquentiam:
‘No doubt, as has been said (viz. c. 37 36 plures tamen bonos
[= valentiam] proeliatores bella quam pax ferunt sqq.) such
turbulent times produce a sturdier eloquence, . . . but' Sine dubio,
like ‘no doubt, sans doute, ohne Zweifel‚' points back to some
thought already cupressea (as here) or implied, and it is thus
distinguished from ‘haud dubie' which is merely a strong assev-

eration of a new thought. Hence Tacitus iuuariahly adds an ’

adversative particle after ‘sine dnbi⁰,' by way of modification or
qualification. cf. Ag. cromanae... superfuere honori tac,
tamen Ann. 16 multa s. d. .. . Augustus ... questus: ceteram
10 pacem s. d. posthaec, verrem cruentam Il 51 victa est s. d. lex,
seul XI 28 subibat admetus. . . narsus. So also in Seneca (see
the cxx. in Kleiber p. 68) and esp. common in Quintilian (cf.
Bonnell Lex. s. v.). This consistent usage would be alone sufficient
to disposa of Maternus as the speaker in c. 36 ff„ for, on that
supposition, he would have made a very emphatic statement with-
out the slightest reservation‚ only to repeat it shortly after for
the purpose of neutralising its validity by a very important modi-
fication l—valeatiorem eloquentiam: Cf. Tac. Anu. IV 21 orandi
validus.

24 sicut indomitur ager habet quasdam herbas laetiores: laetas,
‘satisfactory pleasing,’ is frequently applied to plants. e. g. Verg.
G. I 339 laetis operatus in herbis III 494 laetis moriuntur in
herbis. Cf. the very similar thought in Eur. Hec. 588 K. ri γῆ μὲν
κακή l τυχοῦσα καιροῦ θεόθεν eir στάχυν φέρει.

25 neo tanti rei publicae Gracchorum eloquentia fuit ut patere-
tur et leges: i. e, The Roman people would gladly have dispensed
with the eloquence of the Gracchi, seeing that it was productiva
only of pernicious laws. This disparaging criticism of the Grac-
chan reforms is in perfect accord with the view expressed by
Tacitus in a passage of the Annals (ΙΙΙ 2ῖ), where he even couples
the Gracchi with Saturninus as among ‘turbatores plebis.'—The
peculiarly emphatic position of ‘et leges' is paralleled in Tac. Ag. 4

recepta populi Romani consuetudine ut haberet instrumenta servi· .

tutis et reges.—et=etian1 is found in the Dialogus only in two
other passages: c. 13 24 fatalis et meus dies c. 2127 nisi qui et

carmina eorundem miratur. fecerunt enim et carmina. In the Ag.
(8 times) G. (16) Hist (24) Anu. I-VI (26) xl-xvr (19). See
