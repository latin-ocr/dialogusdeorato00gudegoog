1. lluste Fabi: This Fabius Iustus is very probably identical
with the friend of the younger Pliny (Ep. I 5, 11 and VII 2) and
with the L. Fabius Iustus who was cons. suffectus in 102 (cp.
Mommsen, Hermes III lem-The transposition of the ‘cog-
nomen’ or 'praenomen' is rare in classical prose3 the seemingly
earliest instances are in Cicero (pro Mil. 3 Ahala Servilius, De
orat. 11 62, 253 Vespa Terentius, and some dozen examples in the
laxer and colloquial style of the Epistles). Schmalz (Ueber den
Sprnclryebruuola des Asicius Pollio, p. 52) is, therefore, not alto-
gether aceurate in attributing the introduction oi this usage to
Varro (e. g. de R. R. praei. 6, 2 extr, de L. L. 5, 83). Sporadic
examples are met with in Caesar (e. g. B. C. 111 83) and Nepos
(Att. 18) ; in Livy instances multiply and in postAugnstau authors,
beginning with Velleius, this usage has become exeeedingly common.
Cp. Mommsen, Ito'm. Forscli. I p. 41 ff. and especially Lahmeyer,
Plailol. XXII 476 ff. For Tacitus: R. Mache, Die riim. Elpen-
uamca bei T, who also notes the fact (I p. 12) that these trans·
positione occur in steadily decreasing ratio from the D. (25 ss)
to the 2. part of the Annals (only about 6 (k). Similar inversione
are found iu Greek as early as Dionysius (e. g. Arch. 16 Ἀγρίππας
Μινένιος 24 Βάρρων Τερέντιος), which seems to indicate very clearly

· that this usage must have been rather more common in his time

than the rarity of its occurrence iu the extant literature of the
period would lead us to suppose. —
