See Heller, Pla-ilci, LI p. 347. Hence 'si ita res familiaris exigat'
is in its proper place, aud Wolff's suggestion to transpose the
phrase after 'quidem’ or Andresen's to supply it in thought, is not
only superfluous but notin keepiug with the sense 01 the passage.
—geninm propitiare: Here used in the sense 01 'genio indulgere,
to enjoy the good things 01 life' 01. Pers. V 151 indulge genio:
carpamus dulcia. These phrases embody virtually oue and the
same idea—a fulness 01 expression due to the speaker's desire
to inculcata the importance of pursuing a profession which will
enable a man to acquire, as Aper himself had done, affluence‚ high
political positions and au enviable reputatiou, merely by his own
intellectual efforts and in the face 01 discouraging obstaoles. The
cornmentators less correctly take ‘genium propitiare' in its literal
sense, in reference to the ancient superstition 01 tutelary spirits
(on which cp. Pauly, R. E. 111 693 L. Preller, 19ϋο1. Myris. p. 566
Sruith, Diet. Bioyr. 1124110110 Kiessling, Hor. Ep. ΙΙ1,143),
thus assuming that the poet Bassus had hitherto been invoking the
good will of the 'genius’ of another, which he is now called upon
to abandon in favor 01 his own tutelary deity. With the thought

29 adice quod, like ‘adde quod’ formed on the analogy 01 ‘accedit
quod' (cp. R. V. Ill p. 496 Schmalz, Lat. Synt. p. 499), is first found
in Liv. XXIII 5, 9 adicite ad haec quod. Neither adice nor adde
quod occurs elsewhere in Tacitus. Cp. also Seu. Contr. IX praef.

3, once in Plin. Paneg. 53, 3. and Quint. II 17, 40 adiciunt his qui
contra sentiunt quod. It is, however, especially characteristic of

the younger Seneca, bnt usually in the form ‘adice nunc qnod,' e. g.

30 elaborare et efficere: Ea: in composition, especially in such
words as elaborare and efficere seems to add au intellectual clement
to the original meaning. Cp. R. Υ. ΙΙ 19 1. note 322, a view
clearly confirmed by a passage iu Plin. Ep. V 20,5 Iulius Caudi·
