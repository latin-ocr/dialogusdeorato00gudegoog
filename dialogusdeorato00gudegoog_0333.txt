Ciceronis in hunc diem colliguntur! As the dates 01 the completed
reigns are indisputably historical (cp. Violet, Leipae. Stud. V p. 112.
186 f. 219. 229), the error was supposed to lurk in the date oi
Vespasian's still incompleted reign. The various attempta at
emendation are enumerated on p. 21. They are all intrinsically or
palaeographically improbable, and have consequently met with no
favor save in the eyes 01 their respective authors. Nor does the
interpretation 01 sextam ‘sinthly' proposed by Steiner p. 11 0010 33
and revived hy Kleiber p. 45-48 100111 serious attention, as ‚Jansen
and others have shown. The great majority 01 0111100 have accord·
ingly taken ‘centum et viginti' as around number. Cp. Eckstein,
Proleg. p. 36 J ansen p. 11-18 Violet p. 230 John, correpti. p. 25 ff.
Peter ad loc. This supposition is, however, also open to grave
objections (1) 11 Aper was satisfied with a round number, the
careiully elaborate enumeration was wholly ont 01 place. (2) 1110
not probable that, if ‘centnm et viginti anni' was intended as a
round number, the author would have employed still another round
number, side by side, in reference tc this very passage, aa he does in
c. 25 ext. ceruam 0101911111 annos ab interitu Cic. ete. in hunc diem
effici ratio temporum collegerit and c. 26 4 quos satis constat ante
centum annos fuisse. Iam convinced that the alleged difficulty is
imaginary, being based upon the erroneous assumption that the
words ‘centum et viginti etc' solely express the sum total 01 a
preceding enumeration, 101 this is so far from being the case,
that the very opposite holds good. In other words, the sentence
‘centurn . . . aetas' is in reality tlre picerel point apoc which Aper'c
satire argumentation rests, the enumeration of reigns from Augustus
to Vespasian being brought in solely for the purpose 01 verification.
This interpretation would doubtless have been suggested long
ago, had not the very existence 01 1110 Roman belief that 120 years
constituted the limits 01 a man’s lifetime bcen overlooked. The
indisputable evidence upon this point, 00 far as it has corne under
my observation‚ is furnislred by the following passages: Treb.

(31, 1) proves that 12⁵3 1001110100011110101101101121). Cp. alec Gen. 6, 3.
