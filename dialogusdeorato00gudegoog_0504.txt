of the clepsydra. —It may aleo be ohserved, that this passage
enables us to fix the much disputed date of Cicero’s de legibus to
within a few months, viz. end of dan. aud beginning of April 52
rac. cp. Berl. Philol. Woclr. N 0. 31s32 (1892).—Haco cannot refer
to the entire preceding clause, for the ‘uumerus patronorum' was
not, so far as we know, regulatedby the lex Pompeia. cf. note l. 2.

‘a' imposuitque veluti irenes eloquentiae: The figure, common iu
both Greek arrd Latin, was probably first used by Isocrates Cf.
Suitlas s.v. Ἔφορος : ὅ γοῦν Ἰσοκράτης τὸν μὲν Θεόπομπον ἔφη χαλινοῦ
δεῖσθαι, τὸν δὲ Ἔφορον κέντρου. Cic. de orat. ΙΙΙ 9, 36 quod dicebat
Isocrates se calcaribus iu Ephoro, contra autem in Theopompo
frenis uti solere mouserot ad Att. Vl 1, 12 Quint. 118, 11
Plin. Ep. IX 26, 7 laxandos esse eloquentiae frenos Luciau, Har-

8 omniu in iero, whereas trials are now conducted within the
walls oi ‘auditoria et tabularia’ (c. 39 5) which were originally
designed for quite different purposes. - omnia legibus: cf. Apor's
remark (c. 19 23) ubique apud eos iudices qui vi et potestate, non
iure et legibus cognoscunt, where see notc— omnia apud praetores,
for now the Senate and the Emperor have usurped many important
judieial iunetious, formerly belonging to the praetor. On the ana-
phora, see note c. 36 8.

9 negotiu: ‘cases’ Cf. note e. 3 20.-exereeri: exaetly equiv-
alent to our technioal use of ‘try’ cf. Anu. IV 19 cuneta quae-
stione maiestatis exercita. No other precisely parallel instances
are known to me.

10 censae centumvitales: The jurisdiction of the Centumviri
was always conlined to civil suits, which the republican oratore
could afford to neglect, but when the more important ‘ iudicia pub
liea' had been relegated to the Senate aud the PrineepS, the cases
that came up before the centumviral court furnished the only
opportunity for a display of eloquence. of. note o. 7 0.

12 obruebantur ‘throwu completely into the shade! Cf. Tac. Ag.
17 Cerialis . . . alterius successoris curam famamque obruisset.

14 nt · · · liber apud centumviros dietus legatur: Leyemr has
hitherto always been taken in tho serrse of ‘is now read! But,
apart from the fact that this involves the absurd assumption that
such speeehes were rueressarily of too inferior a character to merit
