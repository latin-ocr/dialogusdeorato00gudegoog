PROLEGOMENA. · XXV

sum total of a preceding enumeration, but is the objecticc point
of Apcr's entire argumentation. The number 120 is a fixed quantity,
for according to a prevalent belief among the Romans just so many
years constituted the ultimate limit of the natural life of man, and
inasmuch as the interval between the death of Cicero and the
speaker’s time does not exceed this limita fact which is established
by the computation of the reigns of the emperors, the injustioe
of the appellation ‘antiqui,' when applied to the orators of the
Ciceronian age, is in Aper's opinion clearly demonst1·ated.²⁶

But if our text is perfectly sound and unobjeotionable, the data
furnished by it are equally unimpeachable. We, therefore, conclude
that the dramatic date of the Dialogue is the year 75 or fl, accord-
ingas we reckou the still incompleted sixth year (iarn) of Vespasian
from lan. 1. 70 or duly 1. 69 A. n. Tacitus was at that time 19s20
years old, presumably a little younger, his friend Pliny only a

. boy of 13s14, and Quintilian nearly 40 and for about three years
the incumbent of a rhetorical ohair in Rome.

This date is in a measure confirmed by a terminus ante quem, pmcn„
furnished by o. 37 off. Mucianus is there represented as still “metuem-
actively engaged upon a work entitled ‘Acta’ ²² But in the follow-
ing passage of Pliny’s Nat. Hist. (XXXII 6, 62) the same Muci-
anus is unmistahably alluded to as one no longer living: Haec siut
dicta de corpore, sed dicemus etde nationibus ne fraudentur gloria
sed dicemus aliena lingua quaeque peritissima huius censurae in
nostro aevo suit Sunt ergo bluciaci verba quae subiciam. Now
Pliny dedicated his Natural History to Titus in 77 A. n. Mucianus
must, therefore, have died a short time previously, the reference
to him being found in the 32d book. Andresen, whom Peter-
lechner, as usual, simply echoes, is not disposed to attach any
validity to the inference drawn from the above passage, because
Pliny may (Ξ) just as well have intended to convey the meaning
‘der, wo es sich um die Behandlung solcher Dinge handelte, in
unserem Zeitalter am eiusichtsvollsten geredet hat' This interpre-

my note ad loc. (pp. 185-187). Dr. Lodge, of Bryn Mawr, ingeniously suggesta
that my view would derive additional weight, ii we read ‘colligantur’ for
‘colliguntur'
