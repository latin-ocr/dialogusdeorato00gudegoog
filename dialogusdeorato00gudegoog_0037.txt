xxx PROLEGOMENA.

admitted to a conversation which took place in the house of a
friend of his teachers, yet remained so studiously in the back-
ground as not even to represent himself as joining in the general
laughter at the close.³² We, therefore, conclude that no argument
against the date of composition under Titus, the only date compat·
ible with Tacitean authorship, can be legitimately drawn from tho
phrase ‘iuvenis adrnodurn.'

We proceed to the discussion of the second objection‚ that the

' Dialogus cannot have been published while Crispus was still living

and in power. It requires but little penetration to see that this
argument, so far from invalidating the early date here advocated,
rather confirnrs it in a remarkable manner. Vibius Crispus, no less
feared as an informer than Eprius Marcellus, who had to commit
suicide after being detected in a conspir'acy against Vespasian in
79, repeatedly got into trouble under this same emperor (cf. Tac.
H. IV 41. 43). During the reign of Domitian, as we have seen, be
was again in high favor, but under Titus we hear nothing of him.
See also note c. 8 21. Now what, Ι ask, can be more probable than
the supposition that Crispus was at that tirne in disgraee, for Titus,
as Suet. Tit. 8 expressly informs us, hated this whole class of
‘delatorea' even going to the extent of prosecutiug them with vigor
throughout his short reign. But instead of adoptiug this common-
sense and intrinsically plausible explanation, which is in perfect
keeping with the necessary presumptive that the Dialogus is a
genuine work of Tacitus, we are called upon to assume a date
toward the close of Dornitian's reign, apparently for no other
reason than that such a supposition would compel us to attribute
our treatise to some unknown cultured contemporary 2⁸⁸ But the
refutation of the objections of Andresen and his allies after all only
justifies the inferenee that the Dialogus may have been written in

⁸⁷ See note to adrisissent, discessimus (c. 42 ext).

⁸⁸ This pernicious mode of argumentation, which nreets us ut cuery turn in
discussions on the arrtlrenticity oi the Dialogus, has been so well characterised
by ltitschk Opusc. 143, that Ι cannot rehaiu from reproducing his protest
here: “ Man wetteifert den Berieht des Altcrthuurs zu verdichtigen, als isenn
von vernherein die Aufgabe galte sich eines widerstrebenden Zeugnisses um
jeden Preis zu entiedigen, wahrcnd doch alle Grundsiitze historischer h'ritik die
Sache gerade umzukehren und eine vielverbttrgerte Ueberlieierung iestzuhalten
gebieten, sobald sie ersi-ens in sich selbst vernilnftig zusammenhiinut und
aweitens durch anderweitige Bedenken und Gegengriinde nicht crschtittert

wlrd.”
