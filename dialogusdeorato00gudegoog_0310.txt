22 anhelans libertus: ‘Iret no freedman in pauting haste ronse
me from my sleep,’ namely, in order to convey some message from
the Emperor, or to bring the irrlormation that his master has arisen
aud is ready to receive the early morning visits of his ‘friends’
cf. Epictet. Diss. IV 8, 41-50, quoted by Friedlauder 1⁶ p. 143.
Schaubaoh p.5 and Weinlrauff p. cnvrrr erroneously take ‘anhelans'
to mean ‘maxime studiosus,’ in which figurative sense the word
would be ἅπ. rip. Cp. also Kleiber p. 75 note—incertus futuri:
Perhaps a reminiscence of Verg. Aen. VIII 580 spes incerta futuri
(ep. Schmaus p. 36). Incertus c. gen. is in prose first found in

ling. lot. aaa, Helle 1882- It was customary ior wealthy Romans ·
to bequeath legacies to the Emperor in their wills in order to iusure
the carrying out of the other bequests, ior, where this cantion was
omitted, emperors such as Caligula, Nero and Domitian (Suet.
sarigas Ner. 32 Dom. 12) osten annulled the testament, appro
priating the entire estate to themselves. Nero, according to Sueto
nius l.c., even went so far as to euact ‘ut ingratorum in prin-
cipem testamenta ad fiscum pertinerent' Maternus therefore,
sincerely hopes that, rather than submit to such compulsiou, his
fortune, unlilre the colossal wealth of Marcellus and Crispus of
which Aper had spoken so admiringly (c. 8), might remain within
moderate limits, so as not to excite the covetousness ο1 the prin-
ceps. No other writer, it may be observed, refers to this practice
more frequently than Tacitus. cf. Ag. 43 satis constabat lecto
testamento Agricolae quo coheredem optimae uxori et piissimae
filiae Domitianum scripsit, laetatum eum velut honore iudicioque.
