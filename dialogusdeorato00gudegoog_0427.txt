Περὶ arsid· ἀγωγῆς (3.5 δεῖ αὐτὸς τὰς μητέρας τὰ τέκνα τρέφειν καὶ
τούτοις ὑπέχειν τοὺς μαστούς 616. This seems, however, not to have
been the general custom either in Greece or Italy. cf. Plut.
Consol. ad uxor. 2 aud Friedlander I 454. 06 1116 source of this
chapter, see Proleg. pp. xcviii-ciii—With the expression ‘in gremic,'
etc, 61. Cic. Brut. 58, 211 legimus epistulas Corneliae matris
Gracchorum: apparet filios 666 tam in gremio educatos quam in
sermone matris.

‘In’ before ‘ gremio’ has been justly inserted, 161 the non-repetition oi
the preposition in adversative clauses is later Tacitean usage. Cf. notes c.
1316 and 21 ³2. —The MS. reading ‘autem,’ no less than the emendations
‘etiam ’ and ‘saltem’ do not appear tome in keeping with the context.
The only intelligible meaning that l am able to extract from the passage is,
that tho personal supervision 61 the mother herself is regarded us stall
times desirable, and that only in case she is prevented 11661 taking charge
61 the training 61 her children, may outside aid be called 16, the utmost
care being requisite in the choice of the mother's substitute. But this inter-
pretation is only possible, ii we read ‘out elig’ Cp. also John, ilicet. Jahrb.

16 probatis spectatisque: The metaphor is derived from the
testing 61 metal or of coins. Cf. Ter. Eun. III 5,18 with Donatus'
note Cic. Verr. II 3, 78,181 Ov. Trist. I 5, 25 spectatur iu
ignibus aurum cic. de 611. lI 11, 38. The same figurative use

maxime adulescentiam Cic. de orat. I 27, 1246616161616116161666

iu that from Lucilius.

18 qua sc. propinqua not ‘subole’ as Andresen and others con-
tend. For this interpretation, iu the first place, interrupts the
sequence 61 thought and requires the suppression 61 ‘eiusdem
familiae! That ‘propinqua' is the antecedent 61 ‘qua' is also
shown by its correlative 'cuius' See the discussion 61 this passage
by John, l. c. aud his note ad loc. (Progr. Hall lacti-neque
dicere ias erat ete: Cf. c. 29 c aut dicat aut faciat. Sall. Cat. 23,

in Greek ancl in Latin. Cp. Otto, Sprtctuarter etc. p. 112.-0n
