explanation ‘they appropriate everythiug to themselves, thus
acquiring their immense wealth at the expense of others,' mis-
interpreta Aper's attitude 'toward these two men. For analo
gous passages, see Liv. III 37 ferre agere plebem plebisque res
andXen.Cyr.1113‚2 πάντες ὗπήντων ἡδόμενοι τῇ εἰρήνῃ καὶ φέροντες καὶ
ἄγοντες ὅ τι ἕκαστος ἄξιον εἶχε, aud Tac. H. Ι 2, 19 (delatores) agerent
verterent cuncta Observe that the usual order of this collocation
common both iu Greek and Latin, is here reversed. So also Homer
E 484 Arist. th. 243 Xen. Hell. VI 5, 50. Such variation is very
characteristic of Tacitus, who seeks to add a touch of novelty to
expressions which had become stereotyped hy constant usage.
Cf. Anu. XIV 38 igni atque ferro for the regular ‘ferro ignique.’

19 cum quadani: In the nial, the anastrophe of the preposition
is habitually avoided (see c. 22 13 curn quodam lumine), except in
formulaic expressions such as eaque tle re (c. 2 4) quem ad modum
(c. 33 t) magua exparte (e.351·2) and the like. Cp. Α. Gerber,

20 venerabilis senex et patientissimus veri: Vespasian was at
the time in which this conversation is alleged to have taken place
(vt-75 nu), 65 years old, having been born on the lith of No
vember 9 arn-As Marcellus and Crispus are represented in c.
1315 as ‘adligati omni adulatione nec imperantibus umquam satis
servi videntur nec nobis satis liberi,' it will be plain. even il we
malie all due allowance for liaternus' unfriendly attitude, that
‘patientissimus veri’ cannot refer to the παρῤησία of these two rnen
toward their sovereign. The praise of Vespasian seems to be
introduced simply by way of apology for openly characterising his
all-powerful friends as the real power behind the throne, a criticism
which even so rnild·tempered a ruler might be liable to resent.
Vespasian’s great tolerance ot outspokenness is well attested by
Suet. l'esp. 13 Amicorum libertatem, causidicorum ligurus ac philoso
phorum contumaciam lenissime tulit and Eutr. Vll 13 Offensarum

phis in se dicta tulit-Aper would have had uc scruples in suh
serihing to Seneca's dictum (de ira11136): vide non tantum an
verum sit, quod dicis, sed an ille eui dicitur veri patiens sit. cf.
also the close of his speech (c. 10).
