serious obstacle to those who denied the genuineness of the
Dialogus, and accordingly we are not surprised to find that Lipsius
was bent upon impugning the validity of the evidence itsell, his
contentiori being that the name might have been added to the
treatise,handed down to us ἀδέσποτον, by accident or design. When
it became known that a far greater number of MSS. of the Dialogus
existed than Lipsius had supposed, it was claimed that his inferenoe
still held good, inasmucb as these MSS. were not so many inde·
pendent witnesses but were all ultimately derived from a sirryle
copy, not older than the middle of the XIII. century.¹⁶ Taking this
very questionable fact in connection with the observation (1) that
the Dialogus invariably occupies the last place in a codex miscel-
laneus containing also the Suetonius fragment and Tacitus'
Germania, Hess and Haase confidently argued that the presumably
anonymous treatise owed the name of Tacitus to the Germania

immediately preceding it.¹⁶ Uniortunately, the order of the three
treatises in our MSS. irrefutably disproves this very premise¹⁷ and
with it the inference based upon it, for the Germania precedes the

scholare such as Sabellicus and Peutinger and editor oi Terence, Sallust, Varro,
Livy, Pliny the Younger, and Quintilian, quoted a passage lronr the Dialogus oi
Tacitus (c. 26 a). This seemed such strong testimony in lavor oi the historiau
that Lipsius, as we bave seen, wishing to get rid oi this awkward evidence at all
hazards, stultified hinrseli by accusing Sabinus, whom be styles meabilis gram-
maticus, oi iorging the citationi Gutrnann reiterated the same absurd charge
and Fr. lless p. 16 actually censured the learned Italian for attributIng the phrase
‘calamistros Maecenatis' to Tacitus, whereas it is in reality used by Messalla 1
The citation oi course proves nothing except the well-known lact that no sus-
picion was entertained regarding the Tacitean authorsbip oi the Dialogus beiore
the time oi Rhenanus. Sabinus may easily have obtained his information irom
some oi the printed editions published during his lite-time or even from some
his, ile is known to have copied the Agricola with his own band. Cp.
