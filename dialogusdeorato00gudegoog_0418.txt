24 satiauit: ‘could not bring himself, did not venture,' like the
Homeric τλῆναι. The construction with the infinit. occurs first in
Ovid, e. g. Her. V 30 Met. Vl 367 and in prose in Seu. Contr. I
praef. 24 Vell. II 86, 2, thereafter very common. Iu Tac. only
here and H. Ι 37 nee privatum me vocare sustineo. Both of these
examples are omitted by Dr. H. S. ΙΙ 334.—incusato Asinio et
(laelio et Calvo: The participle agreeing iu the sing. with the
nearest proper name. Cp. note c. 26 18 and Audresen, Append. to

27 alium Ciceroni, allum caesari: There is unquestionably a
slight incongruity, as Vahlen, Prooem. 1878s9 p.5 has observed,
iu the unexpeeted substitution of two new names in place of those
just enumerated, but Messalla means to point out that Aper, if he
desired to show the superiority ol modern eloquencc by means of a
comparison, ought not to have directed the brunt of his attaclr
against the three first-named orators, but should rather have singled
out the admittedly greatest oratorical representatives of that
period, namely Cicero and Caesar, pitting them severally against
the most eloquent men of the present. See Andresen's note ad loc.

Spengel’s proposal to insert ‘allum Brutum' does not remove, but in-

nation. '

deinde, practically equivalent to deinceps, So H. I 51 Sequanis
Aeduisque ac deinde, prout opulentia civitatibus erat, infensi.

But ‘deinceps' may have been the original reading, the two words being
easily conlounded‚ owing to similar abbreviation. Cp. e. 9 ⁵ deinceps-

nunc: ‘instead3 now, however,' a very common use of the word
in Tacitus. Cp. Lex. Tac. p. 985.

XIII 56, also once in Quint. X 7, 1. The adj. ‘publicus’ is
frequently used in the same sense in Silver Latin, e. g. Seu.

In Cicero only in the ordinary meaning, e. g. de leg. agr. 115, 13
