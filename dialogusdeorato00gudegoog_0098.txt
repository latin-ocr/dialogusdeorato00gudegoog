But if the Dialogus, barring a certain historical background and &lmu-
a tolerably faithful portraiture of the interlocutors themselves,
must be regarded as a worlr of the creative imagination, the
question as to the Scurrae which the author consulted and utilised
at once assumes an independent and intrinsic importance.
That Cicero’s worhs were the chief and foremost of these Sources Cim·

is universally admitted and sufficiently clear from the foregoing.
But that the youthful autbor’s indebtedness to the great orator
extends far beyond phraseologioal imitation and the repetition of
dramatio motiveS, is made equally manifest by the astonisbingly
large number of reminisceuces of Ciceronian ideas in general.
indisputable analogies in other ancient writers would alone have
amply warranted the assumption that Tacitus' appropriatione were
not restricted to the passages expressly cited from Cicero.¹⁸⁰
Happily we are not confined to mere inferences, justifiable though

The following orations are incidentally alluded to: pro fullio, pro Caecina

pro C. Cornelio, pro M. Scauro, pro L. Bestla, in P. Vatlnlum (c. 39 ab), pro
Milone (3821 39 21). in Verrem (c. 20³ 38 tr). Flnally the general statements
