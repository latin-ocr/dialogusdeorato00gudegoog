c. re. 205

οανιια (pro Sest 10, 24 enervati atque exsangues), exilia ιὀἰιιαιιι
(Seu. Ep. 75, 3 non. . . ieiuna et arida volo), concisum, intantum
(de orat. 1138, 159 111 18, 66), siccas (Quint. XI 1, 32), opposed
to cis, virilis, lncani, wervi, sacrae See below.

'I'he passages just cited, and the remarkable general agreement between
Tacitus and Quintilian, pointing unmistakably to a common source, ought
to leave no doubt that ‘exsanguem et aridum' represents the genuine read-
ing. The examplcs usually adduced from Quintilian in support oi ‘attritus,’
s. g. X 1, 27 attrita cotidiano actu forensi ingenia 4, 4 sit ergo aliquando
quod placeat.. . ut opus poliat, non exterat, seem to have little, if any-
thing, in common with the passage under notice, and are in any case not
sufficient to offset the convincing evidence in favor oi the repeatedly-occur- ’
ring collocation in the text. Cp. also Peter ad loc.

24 otiosum: ‘tedicus dull, monotonous,’ c. 22 12 otiosus circa
excessus ‘wordy' Often synonymous with ‘supinua lentus, tardus!
Peterson, to Quint. X 1, 27, rendere the word in both passages by
‘wearisoma spiritless,' but it is not¹ likely that Cicero and Brutus
accused each other of the identical fault. See below. ‘Otiosum'
is used in particular reference, it would seem, to the philosophie
discursiveness of Brutus, while in c. 22 it pertains to Cioero's lack
of succinctness and conciseness of expression. Cf. Stat. silv. IV
9, 20 Bruti senis oscitationes and Quint. X 2, 17 tristes ac ieiuni
Pollionem aemulantur, otiosi ac supini, si quid modo longius cir-
cumduxerunt, iurant ita Ciceronem locutumm fuisse. -diiunotum
‘disjointed' Sandys in his excellent account of Brutus in Cio.
Orat. p. avim thinks this epithet refers to ‘the absence oi aflowing
and harmonious rhythm' Iam rather inclined to understand it
of the epigrammatic and laconio style which Brutus, according to
Plut. Brut. 2, affected in his Greek writingS, for of his Latin diction

· the biographer expresses no opinion, being no competent critic

(Cf. Life of Dem. 2): Ῥωμαϊστὶ μὲν οὖν ἤσκητο πρὸς τὰς διεξόδους καὶ
τοὺς ἀγῶνος ἶκανῶς ὁ Βροῦτος Ἑλληνιστὶ δὲ τὴν ἀποφθεγματικὴν καὶ

. Λακωνικὴν ἐπιτηδεύων βραχυλογίαν ἒν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς ε’νιαχοῦ παράσημός

iona This view seems confirmed by the use of ‘fractum' which,
like ‘dissolutus dissipatus,’ would bc synonymous with ‘diiunc-
tum' All is periectly clear, if we refer Cicero's strictures, more
, particularly to the matter, those of Brutus to the style. Cp. note
c. 26 3 f. diiunctum aud attilam, like ‘elaboratus' (l. 12), are not
yet used by Cicero of persons. -rursnsque=‘0n the other hand,'
ai, is common in Tac. e. g. Ag. 29 H. 111 52 IV 14 V4 Anni
12. 80 II 39 XI 28 XIII 13. 14.
