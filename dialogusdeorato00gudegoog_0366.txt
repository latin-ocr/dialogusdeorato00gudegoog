denoted the obiectione made by defendant against the statements
of the plaintiff which were inserted in the praetor's edict. The

p. merea-n. Tullio: Cicero made two speeehes (72s1 0. 0.) 10
behalf of this Tullius against P. Fabius, one of Sulla's veterane
who had destroyed the plaintiff's villa near Thurii. The first
speech is entirely lost and the second only preserved in some
palimpsest fragments— Aulo caecina: This extant spe'ech was
· delivered in 69 0. 0. before the ‘reciperatores' and deals with an
intricate will case. Its technical nature is expressly alluded to by
Cicero himself in Orat. 29,102: tota mihi causa pro Caecina de
verbis interdicti fuit: res involutas definiendo explicavimus ius
civile laudavimus, verba ambigua distinximus, where see Sandys’
excellent note-Among the fifty-five complete orations of Cicero
which have come down tous, the pro Caecina ranks 11th in point
of bulk, so that the epithet ‘inmensa' is clearly not so great an
exaggeration as Peter thinks, especially as it is not likely that
very many of the numerous speeches still accessible to Aper
exceeded the pro Caecina in length. Fortunat. 107, 30 Η., also

groups these two speeehes together: eum exemplo multarum legum ¹

sententiarum: color, corresponding to Gk. χρῶμα, in its technis-al
postAug. sense denotes ‘the varnish, gloss or color by which the
accused endeavors to palliata the accuser to aggravata, the allowed
facts of the case! These ‘colores' were often collected by rhetori-
cians. Thus the elder Seneca, for instance, arranges his controversiae
under the three heads, sententiae, divisiones and colores. Cp. Mayor,
1uv.V11155. But as 'sententiae' is clearly distinguished from
‘color' (cf. also Quint. IX 1, 18), it is best to take the word in our
passage in its classical signification of ‘beauty, embellishment.’
The phrase ‘color sententiarum’ would theu correspond to ‘color
