founded by scholare e. g. Andresen and Wolff, with his far less
illustrious namesake, the follower of Theodorus of Gadara and

contemporary of Augustus, flourished about 160 c. c. and was tbe
founder of a new system of rhetoric in oppositiou to the Peripatetic
and Stoic doctrines then in vogue. It dealt chiefly, if not exelu-
sively, with εὕρεσις, inventio. As Sandys, Orat. Iatrod. p. xxxvrr
well remarks, ‘the very fact that it was ‹eontined to the considera·
tion of subject matter, which is indepeudent of questions of language,
while it neglected the department of style in which it would have
naturally limited itself to Greek alone, made the teaching of Her-
magoras readily available for use by Roman studente! See also
Wilkins, de orat. Introd. p. 46 f. The Rhet. ad Her. and Cicero's
de inventione seem to be based upon his work, entitled τέχναι
ρητορικαί (ἰιι ‘i bks). Its dry character, owing to an oversubtle
ingenuity of analysis, is also attested by Quint. 11111,21f. haec
