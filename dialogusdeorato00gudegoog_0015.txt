irrelevant matter has been allowed to intrude. In spite oi

this, the commentary may possibly appear to some as out oi
proportion to the brevity oi the treatise itself. Its bulk might,
indeed, have been considerably reduced, but I deemed it more

expedient to cite most illustrative passages in full, being

look up the quotations for themselves, even if they had the
sources within immediate reaeh.

Of more recent editors, 1 desire to acknowledge my indebt-
edness particularly to (ἶ. Audreeeu and 0. Jotn. The former
has also kindly communicated to me the valuable gleanings oi
his recollation oi the Vaticani. As Ι have been compelled to
dissent from Andresen's opinions more frequently than from
those of any other scholar, it may not be out of place to state
that the detailed attention everywhere accorded to his views is
intended as a sincere tribute to the high rank which he

contributione have also been a great help to me, and Ι am the
more glad to make this aeknowledgment, because his leamed‚
acute and instructive notes have hitherto not received the
recognition which they merit.

In conclusion, I can but inadequately ackrrowledge the
depth of my gratitude and obligations to my friend, Prof.
otu. Ε. Bennett, oi Cornell University, who has not only
kindly favored me with many valuable suggestions, but has
also with the greatest care read every line oi proof in its
various stages.

exhaustive Iudex Locorum was compiled by Mr. Homer J.
