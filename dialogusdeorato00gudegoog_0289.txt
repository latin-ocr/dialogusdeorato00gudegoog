§licitatorem eta: The evident desire for succinctness and
clearness is responsible for the peculiar ‘collocatio verborum'
noticeable in this phrase, a conoIseness inimitable in English. The
construction itself is supported by numerous parallels. cf. e. g.

Tire acc. Neronem, which gives a perfectly satisfactory sense, has been
uniiormly rejected by editors, with the exception oi Baehrens. See p. 13.
But the ablntlve cannot under any circumstances be regarded as the original,
lor no conceivable reasons can ever have prompted a scribe deliberately to
alter ‘Nerone' luto ‘Neronem' On the other hand the ablative is easily
explained by tire accidentai omission oi the iiash over the e. The persistent
reitrsal oi crltIcs to accept ‘Neronem' becomes the more surprising when
it isobserved that every other reading involves us in insuperable difficul-
ties. ‘Imperante Nerona' which hae met with great favor, is, in my J'udg·
ment, quite out of placator the chronological information thus imparted
is wholly gratuitous. Every one ol Maternus* hearers must have been per-
iectly iarnilIar with the celebrated achievement alluded to. ‘In Nerone'
could only refer to a praetextata composed by Maternus in Nero's time,
but this is necessarily based upon the assumption that the poet began hls
carcerae a dramatist with praetextatae, an assumption intrinsically irn-
probablc and llatly contradicied by c. 3ex. iYnder these circumstances,
the imaginatae reconstruction oi the plot oi ‘Nero' as gisen by Peter, no
less than the conjecturnl laricies oi liitter and others who identlfy Nero
with the Domitius (0. 3), may he fltly passed by as unworthy of serlous
attention. We must be content with learning that Maternus aeltieved this
signal success by some drama in which VatinIue was covertiy though unmls-
