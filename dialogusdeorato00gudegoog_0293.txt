146 noras,

5 secedit animun This sentence ought logically to have been
incorporated in the preceding: Non in strepitu . . . reorum sed in
locis puris . . . sedibusque sacris componuntur. But the importance
which the speaker attaches to sylvan retirement as best suited to
poetic contemplation, caused him to eald this idea, by way of promi·
nence, as a principal clause. Quintilian in a long passage (X 3,
22-33) takes direct issue with this view: Non tamen protinus
audiendi qui credunt aptissima in hoc nemora silvasque quod illa

· caeli libertas locorumque amoenitas sublimem animum et beatiorem

spiritum parent, mihi certe iucundus hie magis quarn studiorum
hortator videtur esse secessus . . . Namque illa, (luae ipsa delectant,
necesse est avocent ab intentione operis destinati. . . quare silva·
rum amoenitas. . . et ipsa late circumspiciendi libertas ad se tra-
hunt ut mihi remittere potius voluptas ista videatur cogitationem
quam intendere. These statements are sufficiently general to' be
applieable to pursuits other thau those oi oratory, although Quin-
tilian primarily intended them for the latter.

6 haec· · · hacc· · - hoc· - · sic: This particular anaphora is logi·
cally justified only, if ‘primordia’ and ³ penetralia’ are not taken in
a too strictly local sense. The anacoluthon, spoken of above,
caused 'haec' to be joined to ‘sedes' as its real antecedent, where·
as, in reality, it refers to the act of poetic composition implied
in the preceding clause, i. e. poetry composed amid the woodland
seclusion of hallowed places is the earliest and holiest form which
eloquenee assumed! For a similar anaphora cf. G. 18 hoo—hoc

7 commoda: 'accommodating herself to the primitive minda of
the men of that early period' i. e. it assumed the form which best
suited their understanding. For this meaning of ‘commoda’ see
