monographic treatment by the ancients, more particularly hythe
Greeks.¹⁹² The originale have unfortunately been entirely lost, or
preserved only in meagre and insignificant fragments, but among

these Chrysippos' Περὶ ratior ἀγωγῆς seems to have been the most
extensively used. Its popularity was not so much due to any
originality of treatment, stylistic charm or profundity of observa
tion, for the Stolo Chalcenteros was not distinguished for any of
these qualities‚ hut rather to the accumulation of the opinions oi
others,¹⁹⁸ which could not but make his compilatione a repository
of useful information‚ highly welcome to later writers. We are
accordingly not surprised to find that Quintilian, in discussing the
education of children, has recourse to this identical treatise of
Chrysippos, and, what has hitherto escaped notice, thet the un·
known author of Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς, which has come down to us
under Plutarch’s name, is also indebted fer some of his material to
the same Stoic source. The indisputable proof of this is furnished
by tha following passages τ
