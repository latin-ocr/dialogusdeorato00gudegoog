The false conception concerning the relationship of our MSS. is
primarily responsible for the opinion of Michaelis, followed by all
subsequent oritics, with the solitary exception of Baehrens and
Scheuer,²⁸² that AB, by reason of their more faithful reproduction
of the archetypon, possess the greater validity. But this view is
erroneous. We may readily admit that the common archetypon of
AB was written by a less learned scribe than the parent MS. of Y;
he certainly was far inferior to the copyist oi the latter in resolving
the many compendia, which unquestionably were a characteristic
feature of their common prototypa It also goes without saying
that a merely ciimaricol preponderance of genuine readings in one
or the other family (locs not in itself constitute a walid claim to
superiority, unless the nature of the variants themselves warrants
such an inference. On the other hand, it is no less true that a
MS. which fails repeatedly to give what the author must have
written, and in which the scribe, for the sake oi slavish adherence
to his copy, discards tho genuine reading close at hand, ought not
to be made the sole basis oi the recension of the text. It is one
thing, to interpolate orto introduce bold changes; it is quite
another, to correct palpable slips oi the copy. The problem, in
