t. 1 veru occurs in constantly decreasing proportion in Tac,
‘verum’ is first used in tlte Annals. Cp. Spitta p. 150 Dr. ΙῙ. S. II
131. On tlre original distinction between ‘vero’ as an asseverative
particle, and 'verum’ as an adversative conjunction, as we lind it in
Plautus, cp. Langen, Beitr. κιι Plout. 113 ff. and in general Nttgels·

occurs but twice in all.

Moderati is the reading oi the X class, but this has justly been discarded
by several editors ior modesti ot the other MSS. Modestus is the vox
propria for a conscientious judge (ci. Tac. Arm. lII 19 id solum Germanico
super leges praestiterimus quod . . . cetera pari modestia tractentur) and
hence modestia is repeatedly combined with probitas e. g. c. 191101
G. aa, 4 modestia ac probitas, and also nnn. XIV 15 modestia aut quic-
quam probi moris.

The insertion oi ‘se' betorc excusent is palaeographically so easy that
there is no reason, in (111111111111118. authority, to assume a 111. etp. The
passage which Peter cites, in support oi an absolute use oi this vcrb, from
Ag. 42 audiit preces excusantis. is not analogous, ior here excusare means
‘to 11111111,1 sr. provinciam. Ii T. had omitted se, he would probably have
