very young and that the language of the treatise was nothis own
but that oi the interlocutors.² A more scientific aud rational solu-
tion oi the difficulties was imperatively called for, and this was
precisely what the critice up to the time of Woelfflin, barring a few
vagae guesses, were incapable of furnishing.

lt is necessary to bear this state of affairs well in mind, if we
wish to understand the sensation which Α. G. Lonye’s alleged dis· Lanae
covery oi nothing less than a contemporary allusion to the Dialogus
in a letter of none other than the younger Pliny, Tacitus' intimate
friend,⁸ created. The letter in question (IX 10) is addressed to
Tacitus and reads as follows: Cupio praeceptis treis parere, sed
aprorum tanta penuria est, ut Minervae ct Dianae, quas ar's pariter
colendas, convenire non possit. Itaque Minervae tautum servi·
endum est, delicate tamen ut in secessu et aestate. In via plane
nonnulla leviora statimque delenda ea garrulitate, qua sermones in
vehiculo seruntur, extendi. His quaedam addidi iu villacum aliud
non liberet. Itaque poemata quiescunt, quae ta inter marrona ur
nvcos commodissime perfici putas. Oratiunculam unam et alteram
retractavi, quamquam id genus operis inamabile, inamoenum magis-
que laboribus ruris quam voluptatibus simile. Vale. The words ‘tu
inter nemora et lucos commodissime perfici putas,' Lange insisted,
contain au unmistakable reference to c. 920 ff, where Aper says:
adice quod poetiS, si modo dignum aliquid elaborare et efficere
velint. relinquenda conversatio amicorum. . . atque ut ipsi dicunt,
in creatora et lucos, id estin solitudinem secedendum est and so
again iu c. 121 f. nenwra vero et laci et secretum ipsum quod Aper
increpabat etc. This argument, taken in connection with the testi·

mony of the MSS. aud a number of internal reasons which Lange
partly reiterated, partly adduced for the first time, appeared so
convincing that the long-standing controversy was generally re·
garded as having been permanently decided in favor of the great
historiau. For whatever weight an unprejudiced critic might be

⁷80 Woltmann and Lange among others.

⁸The flrst announcement oi this flnd was made by Spalding in a note to his
paper on Seneca’s Consolatio ad Polybium, published as early as 1803. But the
hope there expresscd that the fortunate scholar would give publicity to his
discovery was not realised till 1814, when Lange’s short trectise appeared in
Bcck's Acta Sem. et Soc. Philol. Lips. 177-88. But, presumably owing to the
very limited circulation of thia publlcation‚ the author's article attracted no
attention whatever, until Dronke reprinted it in his edition oi the Dialogus in
1828 pp. XVI fl.
