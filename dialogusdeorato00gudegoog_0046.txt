PROLEGOMENA. xxxix

Maternus like Tacitus, siucerely acquiesces in the monarchical
reginis for reasons of expediency, for the existing state of affairs
is still far from realising his political ideals. He willingly
concedes the truth of Secundus' statement that eloquauce found
more favorable conditions of grovth in tho more turbulent times
oi republican Rome, but being firmly resolved to forsake the
irksonre duties of the forum, which had become repugnant to him,
he maintains that the blessings of peace and tranquillity, possible
only under the governrnent of a single ruler, more than counter-
balance the oratorical superiority of tha republican period. Ii
called upon to choose between anarchy and oratorical decadenoe,
he would prefer the latter as the lesser of two evils.⁸⁴

Eloquence, like fire, requires fuel to seed it and motion to fan it
into a blaze3 in fact, any intense literary activity is incompatible
with political tranquillity. This observatiou embodies a truth so
profound, aud one so far removed from mere commonplace plati·
tude, that I cannot believe it to have occurred to two writers
independently oi each other, and when we find to our surprise that
the same thought is met with in but one other passage in extant
literature, namely the— Histories of Tacitus, only blind prejudice
can fail to see the important bearing which this parallelism has
upon the question of authorship.³⁶

The author oi the Dialogus, like Tacitus, deplores the loss oi
freedom of speech, and the risks incurred by giving voice to one's
convictione are alluded to by both.³⁶

But tha striking coincidences do uot end here. Maternus, in
opposition to Aper's admiring comments, has nothing but supreme
contempt ior the abject servility of informers and ‘amici principis'

of dramatic poetry‚ has been well brought out by J. Α. Symonds, studies os the
Greek Poeta 11 p. 11 ii.
