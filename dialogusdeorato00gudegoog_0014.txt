Τ111 present edition of the Dialogus de Oratoribus was begun
as lar back as 1888. Since that time I have spared no effort
to read and carelully examine, sine ira et studio, everything

even those critics who have hitherto espoused other views

in the Critical Notes.
In writing the Bregeticol Commentory I have constantly kept
in mind the golden precept of Seneca: “Quo ducit materia
