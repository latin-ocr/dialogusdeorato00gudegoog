note ad loc.). (3) The passage from Cicero is totally irrelevant and could at
best but prove, very 000011100001)1 01 that, that the uscful and the pieasurahle
may be contrasted. One might with some greater show of justice have ad-
duced Cic. de orat. 1 33, 151), cited above, to prove that the genuine reading
must have been ‘quamquam utilia . . utiliora tamem* for this passage at
least deals with one and the same topic. 'l'he present chapter treats exclu-
sively de voluptate oratoria. l have no doubt that Tacitus wrote: quam-
quam quae diu seruntur atque elaborantur grata, gratiora tamen ‘Although
those things which have been sown and cultivated for along time are
pleasing (because of their maturity) yet more pleasing are' etc. The
changes called forare of the easiest description. qaae (d) was accidentally
omitted after quamquam (i. 0. quernei. cf. c. le te tamti. 32 4 00105. le utri).
Soc. 3 2 ipsum quem for ipsumque quem 39 et quoque qui- o quoque D,
see also Buecheler, 1111. llus. xi, 512 f. Grato dropped out owing to the
following gratiora. hs for alin, omitted, be it observed, in two MSS„ it is
clearly tho corruption of a dittography of diu, the d being mistalren for al,
just as in analogous instancesd 0100110101 ol e. g. c. 21 :reddent (CD) =
redolent. In llor. Ep. 1 lo,37‚11aupt(0puso.11147) conjectured victo
ridens for victor violens. The change finally of ‘a‘ and ‘e’ into ‘u' and
‘a' in the verbs can hardly be called a correction. Perhaps we ought also
to read laborantur for elaborantur, cf. c. 302 and note to c. ills, but this
ie not absolutely necessary. —On the comparative following closely upon
the positive, see Cic. do orat. 1. 0. aud c. 1110 pulchrum id quidem . . quanto
