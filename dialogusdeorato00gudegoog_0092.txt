fragment. If so, he argues, we can ascertain with mathematieal
aocuracy the size of the page of the archetypon by a simple com·
parison with the known extent oi the omissions in Pliny's letters,
these lacunae not being found in all MSS. of Pliny. Habbe thus
calculatos the gap in the Dialogus at onescvcntb oi the entire
treatise.¹'¹ With those who, like myself, are unable to attach any
argumentative validity to his premises, the result reached by means
of them will not carry conviction, and I am inclined to think that
no satisfactory answer can be given to the question under notice
without the accession oi new MS. material.

In the determination of the contents of the lacuna, scholare were
of course influenced by the views which they held regarding the
degree of¹ prominence given by the author to Secundus. These who
maintained that he did not speak at all were unable to invent any·
thing else that might have been spoken by Maternus; of others
who believed that Secundus’ entire speech was lost in the lacuna,
only Brotier has ventured to reconstruct in detail the topics dis-
cnssed in the missing portions. His restoration, though written in
fluent latin, would scarcely deserve mention, save as a jeu d'esprit,
did not Habbe, after giving a short synopsis oi it (p. 10 i), express
his conviction that this supplement is in every way worthy of being
rescued from oblivion. 'Atque Broterium,' he continues, ‘melius
meritum esse puto de aureolo illo libello recte percipiendo quam
nonnullos illorum . . . partis amissae imaginem aon multum a
veriam alienantem ante oculos legentium exposuit! ¹²⁸

This favorable comment is, in my judgment, a deplorable aberra-
tion, for Brotier’s supplement is based upon a complete misunder-
standing, not only of the scope and the plan of the Dialogus, but
also of the attitude and the characteres the interlocutors. The
utteranees pnt into the mouth of Messalla, of Secundus (sic long
chapters are devoted to him) and of Maternus are a kind of con-
glomeration or 'potpourri of criticisms, anecdotos and the like,
culled from Seneca Rhetor, Velleius, Seneca the philosopher,
