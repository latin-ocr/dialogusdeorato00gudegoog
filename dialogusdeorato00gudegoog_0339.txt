years later, three years aiter Asinius, who according to our text is made ta
survive him l Neitber clinton’s suggestion to take ‘durare' ln the sense oi
‘florere‘ a meaning not iound elsewhere, nor Borghesi’s transposition oi the
proper names, removes the historical error involved in ‘in medinm usque,’
etc. ; and even granting that it did, it would still remain highly doubtful
whether a difference oi only three years between tbe deaths oi Asinius and
Messalla could have been properly distinguished by ‘in medinm¹ and ‘ad
extremum.⁹ Nipperdey proposed to read ‘extremum’ ior ‘medium’ bnt
thisias most violent change, which, at the same time, leaves the origin oi
the alleged corruption unexplained. (2) It is a suspicions circumstance to
lind ‘durare’ construed with two different prepositions within the same
sentence, and te observe at tbe same time that ‘in . . . usqne’ is
mter used in Tacitus in a temporat sense and but rarely so elsewhere (cp.
Woelfflin, Paitoi XXVI 139 Tbielmann,ArcbicV1 leesor VII 105 n).
(3) The information, even granting it to be correct, is quite superfluous,
because the words ‘ex. . . potuisse' mem all the requisita precision le
enable aper’s hearers to appreciata the point which he desires to establish.
The entire clause is due to a marginal gloss oi some ancient reader,
perhaps suggested by the passage in c. 38 ts. With this obiectionable
parenthesis out oi the way, the ellipsis before ‘ne dividatis,’ which has
been repeatedly misinterpreted, is now also more natural and easy. Op.

the similar ellipsis in Cic. de orat. II 12, 51 ‘Atqui ne nostros

The insertiones ‘itaque' or ‘igitur' rests upon the non-recognition oi
this brachylogy.

28 antiquos ao veteres· · · potnerunt etc: The entire statement
is somewhat strained in expression, but quite in conformity with
Aper’s style. The speaker’s main object was to show that Cicero
and his contemporaries were not entitled to the name 'antiqui'
menuae they are not removed from the orators of the present time
by more than an ordinary liietime. In accordance with this view,
he regards the possibility that both Cicero and the modern orators
might have been haurd by the sante audiences, as the chronological
connecting-linis between them. This idea is slightly obscured by
