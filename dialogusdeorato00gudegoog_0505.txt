perusal, a supposition sufficiently refuted by the example of Pollio,
the loyieal consequence of ‘adeo splendore aliorum iudiciorum . ..
obruebantur,’ expressed by the consecutive ‘ut' clause, can only be
that such speeches never existed. The evident meaning of the
passage is, therefore, this: 'The splendid rewards which awaited
the talented orator in great public trials, rendered him so corn·
pletely indifferent to cases tried before the Centrunviri, that as a
natural consequence of this apathy, we do aot raud of the delivery
of any speeches of eminent orators before this court, excepting
Pollio's speeches for the heirs of Urbinia etc) For this extremely
rare passive use of legor with the infinitive, of. l'rop. V 11, 36 in

interpretation just given disposes of the alleged inconsistency
which Vahlen (Prooem. Berl. 1881 p. 10) and the commentatore
find in the construction ‘ab ipso tamen Pollione,' in place of ‘ipsae
tamen a Pollione, ‘and even Pollio himself (who is throughout the
Dialogus counted among the ‘magni oratores antiquorum ') con·
stitutes only an apparent exception to the practice of Cicem, etc,

15 pru heredibus Urbiniae: The points at issue are known to us
from Quintilian who refers to this trial repeatedly: IV 1, 11 VII
2,4 est et illud coniecturae genus, cum de aliquo homine
quaeritur, quis sit, nt est quaesitum contra Urbiniae heredes ‘is
qui tamquam filius petebat bona, Figulus esset an Sosipater. . . an
hic sit ex Urbinia natus Clusinius Figulus' and esp. VII 2, 26 ut
in lite Urbiniana petitor dicit, 'Clusinium Figulum lilium Urbiniae
acie victa, in qua steterat, fugisse, iactatumque casibus variis,
retentum etiarn a rege tandem in Italiam ac patriam suam Marru-
cinos venisse atque ibi adgnosci’: Pollio contra, ‘servisse curn
Pisauri dominis duobus, medicinam factitasse, manu missum alienae
se familiae venali inmiscuisse, a se rogantem, ut ei serviret, emp

ce‘libre and Pollio’s speech was probably excerpted in the collec-
tion of Mucianus, whence Tacitus also took the date.
