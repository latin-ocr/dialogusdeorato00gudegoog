Materni extat sed haec omnia continenter sub Messallae persona
leguntur! Lipsius did not pursue the thought any further, nor did
he state his reasons, but ho doubtless felt, as Lange and Steiner
did at a later period, that the closing words were somehow incon·
sistent with the previous utterances of Maternus,¹³³ a conviction
which subsequently culminated in Strodtbeck⁷s and Eckstein's
interpretation of Maternus' closing address as ironical, a suppo-
sition which obviated the assumption of a lacuna and allowed the
whole speech to be spoken uno tenore by the interlocutos whom
the MSS. expressly designate as the last speaker.

Lipsius' conjecture was universally rejected or ignored for nearly
300 years, until Steiner¹⁵⁸ endeavored to restore it to honor, only
differing from him in that he substituted demendam in place of
Messalla, as the preceding speaker, partly because Messalla would
otherwise have monopolised the discussion of all the causes of the
decline of eloquence, partly because he was convirrced that Secundus
could not have been so strangely ignored by the author. A lacuna
after c. 407 he rejected, because the MSS. do not indicate it.¹⁶⁰
Steiner found some support for Lipsius' view in a few dots which
Cyrillns asserted were found between the words ‘utatur' and
· ‘finierat' in the codex Farnesianus (Ο).100 But even granting that
these problematice] dots pointed unmistakably to a lacuna, Steiner’s
theory, which has found no follower savo Weinkauff (p. lxviii,
lxxxiv), falls to the ground, if it can be shown that the c. 36-42

sondern es ist dic natltrliche (l) Fortsetzung des bis dahin erdrterten politischen
Zustandes aus dem Munde einer und deroelben Person. Diese Person aber,
welche jene politischeu Ursachen der Bcredsamkeit darlegt, kann Maternus
nicht gewesen sein,' for the reason given by Lange. See note 157.

Ψ) “interest spatium distinctum ac lacunam indicans.'' Eckstein in
Walther's edition, followed by most critica, supposed this insignificantly small
space tc have been left vacant “ad tinem sermonis indicandum,'' while
Baehrens (Coram. Urit. p. 99 note) thought “nil nisi litteram initialem omissam
esee scillcet a rubricatore addendam, id qnod de Vaticano (A) quoqne testatur
Michaelis '' (via. inierat-F in margine minio picturus erat librarius). But the
very existence ot these dots in C is doubtful. Michaelis is allent about the
Farnesianns, and no trace ot any dots or vacant spaces is found ln the other
MSS. in the place mentioned!
