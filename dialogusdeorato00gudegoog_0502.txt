...sumebat is simply an amplification of the preceding, but was

preceded by the letter s. (i. e. scilicet) in C. This points uumistakably to
‘ paucissimas horas perorare* or ‘paucissimas perorare boraa' as the original
reading of the archetypon. The latter seeum preferable, ‘horas’ easily
dropping out aiter ‘orare‘ Dr. E. Thomas suggests (by letter) that ‘horas’
isan explanatory gloss and that we have here an ellipsis similar to the one
dlecussed in note c. 218 Calvi (sc. librum) in Asitium legit, but this iuter-
pretation, though ingenious, seems less natural and somewbat hazardous

‘dicendo’ Thero can, therefore, be no doubt that ‘in dicendo' is the
original. ‘ln' having dropped out, because of the preceding ‘m.’ ‘dicendo’
was changed to ‘dicendi' e. g. in the worthless eod. Parisinus and in the
oldest printed editions. Cf. c. 75 quantulaecunque in dicendo facultatis
