Cicero has but oue instance in the speeclres (pro Lig. 35 hi tui). In
Quint. it is very rare (e. g. I 3, 3 hic meus) but in I'liny's letters,
as we are not surprised to observe, it is correspondingly frequent.

2 frequent 01 adsidua: John well remarks that the interposition
01 ‘nobis’ strongly favors the predicative meaning of these words
rather thau the usual interpretation which regards them as one of
the very numerous instances 01 11111000 01 redundaucy of expres·
sion in the D. This view is also in a measure confirmed by
Cicero who (pro Plano. 8 ext.) has the phrase ‘adsidua frequentia!
‘To disputo repeatedly and earnestly has almost become a habit
with us'

are particularly abundant iu Aper's speeclres and may have been
designed to give an individualistic color to his style. Nearly all 01
them can be paralleled from Cicero, where they are, however, very
often found in the 11110100 order, a fact which in many instances
betrays direct indebtedness on the part of Tacitus. (11.0. 1 14
