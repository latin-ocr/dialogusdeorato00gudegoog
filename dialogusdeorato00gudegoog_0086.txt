which we possess, after aa *ieter-certine space of only anans os noun
munes, continues with 'quattuor et quadraginta orationes seper ce
rc habitae,' and yet there is not only a buge gap in the narrative,
covering a period of two years, but modern scholare, following
Lipsius, even begin a new book at this point, no previous editor
having had the slightest suspicion of a lacuna 1¹⁶⁸ Now when it is
observed that the editors of the Dialogus before Beroaldus dc not
even indicate a lacuna after c. 35 (doubtless because they found
none in the MSS. from which their text was printed) and that our
best MSS. are some foer centuries younger than the Mediceus and
incomparably inferior to it in point of scholarly accuracy and carc,
it is certainly no rash inference to assume that the scribes of our
late MSS. may possibly bave failed to mark a lacuna after c. 417,
supposing it to have existed in the archetypos, when a vacant space
of three or four letters was thought sufficient to represent an im·
measurably greater gap in the Annals, not to mention that it is
just as possible that this small space may have been after all only
intended to indicate the ieyinniny of a new paragraph! We there·
fore conclude that even in the absence of any externat evidence,
the assumption of a lacuna will be methodieally justified, if we can
adduce weighty intereat grounds in its favor. Happily these are
not wanting. ’

The speaker of c. 36 had pointed out that the development of
the splendid eloquence cf republican Rome was directly conditioned
and stimulated hythe anarchical state of affairs which then existed
(horum quoque temporum oratores ea consecuti sunt quae cowrposite
et quieto et beate re publiea tribui fas erat tamen ille perturbatione
ac licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, cum evictis omelias ct
nwderaiore unc carentibus). This is the very corner·stcne of his
argument, and he therefore, lest it be lost sight of, repeats it in the
very next chapter (e. 37 29 f. sed ut caediedc admoneo, quaestionis

¹⁶⁸ It will also be noticed that both sentences, at the beginning and the end
of the lacuna, are complete in serrae, which disposes oi another objection (made
by Peter, Wolff, and others) to the effect that the grammatical eompleteness of
the two sentences in the Dialogus (c. 417) militates against the assumption of a
lacuna. As a matter of lact, gaps would be far more easily overlooked in such
cases than if the sentence broke off in the middle, as it does in c. 35 ext. So
e. g. in Plaut. Most. 940 A utone reveals the existence oi a lacuna.
