not help thinking that nature had rather marked him out fora
scholar than for the active and less peaceful vocation 01 00 advo-
cate, and hence we are not snrprised to learn that he also devoted
himself to historical researeh, and had published an admirable
biography 01 Julius Africanus (c. 14 21 f.).

In the present mutilated condition 01 the Dialogue, Secundus
scarcely figures as an interlocutor at all. But that the author did
assign to him a much larger share in the conversation seems to me
indisputable. For the conspicuous manner 01 his introduction, the
0010101 description 01 the 01010110010101001011011000110000110οἀ
Aper, with whom 110 10 placed upon 0 perfect footing 01 equality,
finally, the very phrase 01 the prooemium, ‘cum singuli . . . 000000
adferrent,' no less than the words in 0168 pro duobus promitto:
nam et ego et Secundam exsequemur eas partes etc.,¹⁴⁸ render the
supposition that the author had nevertheless condemned him to
silence throughout the debate quite inconceivable. But whether
his contributiou to the discussion was lost in 1110 large lacuna 01101
0. 35, which has been the opinion 01 00010 scholars, or whether we .
still possess part 01 11 10 the speech commonly assigned 10 Maternus,
is quite another and more difficult question, which we shall endeavor
to answer at the close 01 the chapter.

Secundus' want 01 0101011001 facility may well account 101 his not appearing as

expressly attributes what he regards as 00 unjust accusation, to the molionity
