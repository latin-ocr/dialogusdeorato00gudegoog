the previous conversation. Messalla expresses his sincere delight
on learning that his friends, as indeed hefits men of true culture,
employ their leisure hours in discussiug subjects not directly con-
nected with their profession, and compliments the eminent lawyer
Secundus ior his historica] researchcs, while Aper, no less illus·
tricus as an advocate, is ironically praised for not allowing his
forensic duties to alienate him from the theoretical and scholastic
exercises oi modern rhet01·icians.¹³⁰ This last utterance (otium
suum mavult nouorum rhetorum more quam veterum oratorum con-
sumere), though apparently nothing more than a harmless, ironical
iling at Aper's fondness for the rhetorical practices oi his time,
which Messalla held in very low estimation (see c. 35), is oi para-
mount importauce in the dramatic development of the Dialogue.
For, by calling forth Aper's rejoinder: Non desinis, Messalla,
υοίονα tantum et antiquo mirari, nostrorum autem stadia inridere
atque contemnere . . . cum acmirwm hoc tempore oratorem esse con-
tenderes, the question which is to form the main theme oi discus-
sion is with wonderfully artless art brought upon the tapis. It iu
turn naturally leads to the desire oi learning the reasons for this
vast difference between the oratory of the past and the present
(c.1511f.), a difference which, in Messalla’s opinion, was not
brought about by any healthy progress, but by the gradual abandon-
ment oi loftier standards. The conflict having thus been prepared,
and a distribution oi the contesting speakers arranged, the debate
begins. Aper, who has to stand up single-handed against a united

opposition, opens the discussion (c. 1614) by a casuistical argument
concerning the relative meaning of the term ‘antiqui' and its
proper applicability to the orators of the'Roman republic, and theu
passos on to a scathing indictment of its greatest representatives
and a glowing eulogy of the characteristic features of modern
eloquence.

Messalla thereupon takes up the cudgels for his belovcd
‘ancients,’ so disparagingly criticrsed by Aper, but, being recalled
to the main theme at issue, giveS, what he regards as the principal
reason for the decline of eloqueuce. The close of his argument
is lost. The next speaker, wh0, as we shall show below, is
Secundus, supplements, according to the agreement made in c.

¹³⁰ Maternus is not likewise commended ior the versatility oi his interestis,
because though he too was an advocate by profession, his· poetica} predilections
vere too well known to have special attention drawn to them.
