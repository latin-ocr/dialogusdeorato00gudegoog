“ rhetorum (misquoted by Peter). The phrase here implies the

charge that these corrupters of youth unjustly arrogated a Greek
name to themselves, which always designated a highly respectable
calling. Possibly the Greek accusative plural was used for
the express purpose of calling attention tc this fact, for rhetoras
occurs only here, c. 35 13 and in the very Senatus consultum (cited
c. 35 e) referred to in both of the Dialogus passages. On the very
rare use of Greek endings in Tacitus, see note c. 31 34.

‘De curiis' seems to be the temnant of emarginal glou (see p. 38) which,
on becoming incorporated into the text, caused the conuption now exist·
ing. If sc, the numerous emendations proposed cannot be seriously con-
sidered as even plausible restorations of the archetypon. But quite spart
from this, most of these conjectures, on their authors* own admission, can
only refer to a statement of Messalla in a subsequent speech, which he at
this stage of the discussion clearly had no intentiones delivering. See the
closing words of e. 32. Andresen, wishing to avoid this objection, contende
that the promise implied in ‘statim dicturus' is actually fuldlled at once,
the unpopularity of rhetorical schools being made manifest by the following
account of the course of training which the ancient orators, or rather Cicero
aa their representative, underwcnt. But this interpretation, besides involv-
ing a petitio principii, does not call fora phrase like ‘statim dicturus* by
the side of referam necesse est. Michaelis', Peter's and Nipperdey‘s
emendations are palaeographically quite impossible. Nor is Vahlen's
‘decursurus' (Procem. Berol. 1881 p. 11 f.) convincing.
