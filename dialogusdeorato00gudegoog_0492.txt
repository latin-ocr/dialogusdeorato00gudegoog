which Pliny (and perhaps Josephns) has preserved some very

8 nt opinor does not express any genuine doubt as to the actual
number of books already published‚ but simply serves to avoid an
air of learning in what pnrports to he an informal conversation
between friends. Cp. note c. 32 27.—Aetorum libris: ‘Acta' as
the context shows, must not be taken in its technical sense of
Acta populi, or acta senatus, publica, diurna, urbana ὑπομνήματα,
on which see Mommsen Ram. Staatsr. 1111017 Teuffel ξ 216

Suppl. 1115 pp.558-632‚ but as a general title, virtually equiva
lent to ‘Actiones’ (cf. c. 17 21 32 11). The work ef Mucianus
probably contained an epitomiscd selection of the more noteworthy
speeches delivered in the assembly, the senate, the forum and the
law-conrts, with sundry biographical and chronological notes of
interest, and it has been plausibly conjectured that many of the
oratorieal fragments preserved in Gellius, Fronto and Macrobius
were taken from this identical compilation. To the same source, Ι
am disposed to attribute the information given in c. 34 ext. ancl the
learned item in c. 38151. where see notes and cp. also Proleg. p.
