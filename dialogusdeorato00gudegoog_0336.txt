13 longum 01 unm: The reigns of these three emperors exceeded
one year but lasted less than two (June 6. 68 - Dec. 20. 69), hence
styled ‘that one memorably long year'3 mernorable‚ because so
many stirring events occurred within 00 shorta period( Observa
thet ‘unus' in Tac. does not precede, except when joined toa
numeral, so always in the phrase ‘unus . . . alter,' or to ‘idem’
(e. g. c. 22 90 G. 24). cf. c. 34 31 with note and 41 16.

14 emtionem: ‘sixth year 01 the reign of Vespasian' In this
sense, the word is not used elsewhere. See Dict, Kleiber, Jansen
1100. No valid reason, however, has been or ean be adduced
against the admissibility 01 this interpretation, for it alone brings
0011110 intended meaning of the passage without arbitrary altera

tions oi tho text. The Dialogus-and Aper's speeehes in par·
ticular-furnish numerous instances of words used in peculiar
significatione. cf. e. g. 0. 9 28 genium propitiare 12 9 sanguineus

16 10 hunc diem: ‘to the present day' So constantly e. g. c.
24 0111. Ag. 30 H. 130 IV 64 1100111142. The interpretation
of Andresen and others ‘down 10 this very day' is based upon the
assumption, discussed at length in a previous note, that ι00010001
viginti’ represents the exact sum total of a preceding enumera
tion, but this implies an error which has been shown not to exist,
and compels us to place the debete in the year 77, adate rendered
impossible by 0. 37 7, where see note. Cp. also l’roleg. xxiv n. 23.

17 ipse ego: Ego is made purposely emphatic by position, in
order to add strong confirmation to what might seem an exag-
001010010101010001ἢ 100. 15 11, such emphasis would have been oi
too direct and personal a nature, hence ‘vos ipsi,' On the position
of ‘ ipsi,' when joined to the oblique cases ol the personal pronoun,
see note 0310-1010101011 Usually explained as a consecutive
subj. ‘so old was he that he was able to say‚’ but is perhaps 1101101
taken as a snbj. of characteristic. —On the alleged longevity

IV 20-36 114-23) leave no doubt that the earlier of these is

here meant-Britanniae· · · adgrmi eunt: The subject 'Britanni’
