The generally accepted reading ‘numerosior' was due to awrongsolu-

tion oi a compendium, still preserved in cod. A. It is lem probable than
“nervosior' ior two reasons: (1) Messalla’s criticisms throughout turn

upon paracl characteristica ol style, and not upon technIcal or formal .

qualities; (2) ‘numerosior' istoo much at varianae with Seneca’s judg-
ment on this point (cited c. 21 as) to render it plausible that Messalla should
deliberately single out this feature as particularly characteristic or praise-
worthy in Pollio’s speeches. John's interpretation oi Seneca's criticism
does not convince me.

Messalla omits his aucestor, Messalla Corvinus, for obvious reasons.

Tacitus uses ‘prae se ierre “ (Ag. 43 G. 39) as well as ‘praeferre’ (Anu.
XIII 3). Andresen‘s emendation has been received into the text, because
praeseferunt was more easily corrupted into ierunt than praeierunt, tha
apparent dlttography oi ‘se' causing the omission oi ‘prae’
