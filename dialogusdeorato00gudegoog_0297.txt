l. c. regards the above passage as an 00110 of the Stoicism 01 the
author’s day, rather than a literary reminiscente. This may be
true, but the parallel utterances iu the Dialogus do not appear to
have been taken from this source directly, but were more probably
due to Cicero's Hortensius, a work to which Tacitus is more largely

indebted thau has been hitherto supposed. See note c. 16 24 and
