signifies simply ‘orationes' as again in c. 32 13 and frequently in
Quintilian e. g. X 1, 21. 22 (000 Bonnell, Lex.) and Plin. Ep. II
5,1 IX 13, 23. Tha word in this sense, like actor=orator (c. 267)

cited by Peterson 1.0., is certainly not due to Cicero

vessel that held a congius (about 3 qts.). It was subsequently
applied to largesses given to the people (cf. Quint. VI 3, 52 congia·
