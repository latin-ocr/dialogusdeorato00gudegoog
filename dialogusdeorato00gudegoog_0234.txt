Aper regards as the only true eloquence. This view is confirmed
by the generis meaning 01 the word eloquentia in 0. 10 13, where it

' is made 10 include poetry as well as oratory. In order, therefore,

to restrict it 10 the latter only, distinguishing epitheta such as
virilis (cf. Cic. ad 1001. 1 9, 23 0010 me iarn ab orationibus diiungo
1010 referoque ad momuetiores Musas) and oratoria were necessary.

14 parcre simul et tueri: Taceri carries on the thought 01 ‘parere’
and we should, therefore, expect 'ac' or ‘atque' according to Taci-
tean usage pointed out c. 4 3. But here and again 1101000100ος-
nare pariter et incessere,’ the rule is only apparently violated, for
the insertiones simul and pariter has the effect 01 making the
action expressed bytho two verbs appear simultaneous, coalescing,
as it were, into one idea. Τ. 0000 ‘simul et' more frequently than
the classical ‘simul ac' which is chiefly found in the minor writings.

assiduously to the other. 1 000 00 reason for departing from
the usual interpretation which supplies in thought 00 ‘id’ before
studium. The alleged repetition is occasioned by the design 01
the author 10 depict Aper as a trained rhetorician who carefully
enumeratas the various subdivisions 01 his argument which 110
subsequently discusses in regular order. It is strange that John,
whomalres the same observation, did not see that it renders his
own suggestion superfluous. -Thc passage from qua . . potest con-
tains two climaxes, one asyndetio, the other polysyndetic. The
last member of the second is moreover amplified 10 give a sonorous
finish. For cxx. of this peculiarly Tacitean device, see the long
list in Weinkaulf, p. 92-97.
