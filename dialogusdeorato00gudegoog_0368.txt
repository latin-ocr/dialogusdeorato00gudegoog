groupcd together also in Cic. pro Sest. ti, 116 comitiorum et contionum
significationes sunt nonnumquam 01110100 utque corruptae. The alliteration
observable in ‘cursu . .. colore . .. cultu‘ is so evidently intended to
mark 011 the verdone elementa 01 the enumeration, that ‘nitore' which
destroys the stylistic equilibrium, may be justly objected to. lt is probably
a mere marginal or interlinear gloss, suggested by 02311, which subse-

Dicentem ie undoubtedly a superfluous addition, as is also clear from its
unwarrented emphatic position, but to attribute the marginal gloss (asJohn
does) to some ancient reader who had observed that ‘aversari’ is used
transitively elsewhere iu Tacitus, would imply an incredibly proiouud
knowledge oi Tacitean usage on the part oi this interpolator, the passages
being widely scattered in the Historias aud Annals.

lay public which is drawn to the court by an idle curiosity, is

elsewhere in the Dialogus distinguished from the ‘auditores'

et vagus auditor' is not identical with the ‘auditor’ mentioned
in later ehepters but, as the epithets clearly indicate, the second
clause merely singles outone particular clement in this miscel-
