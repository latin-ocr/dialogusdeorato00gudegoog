fovet. Centum attigisti anni ab interitu Ciceronis in hunc diem
colliguntur, unius hominis aetas.) Now in adding up the various
items, it was found, that the sum total only amounted to 117 years
(43 s. c. — itstt n. n). As Maternus repeats Aper's statement iu
almost identical language (c. 24 ext.) and as ‘in hunc diem’ was
taken to mean ‘down to this very day' (Dec. 7. 43 n. c.—Dec. t.
74 Α. 0.),23 the discrepancy appeared so glaring as to be explicabis
only on the assumption of atextual corruption. But as the number
120 was fixed by the repetition mentioned and as the completed
reigns of the emperors cited are known to be indisputably
histor·ical,⁹‘ the error was supposed to lurk in the last item, and
accordingly critics have vied with one another in correcting the
writer’s faulty arithmetic. Their conjectures, enumerated on p. 21,
have deservedly failed to carry conviction‚²⁵ aud hence the great
majority of modern scholars were forced to resort to the expedient
oi taking 120 years as a round number, a supposition which does
not account for the elaborate enumeration preceding.

I am convinced that the difficulties hitherto discovered in the
passage under notice are imaginary, for the statement ‘centnm et
viginti anni etc! neither expresses an exact nor an approximate

Β We are not only under no compulsion to take ‘iu hunc diem' in this sense,
but there are also weighty reasons against its being so interpreted. (1) lt is not
easy to understand how Maternus could have referred back to dper's computation
more accurately than by repeating his own words, a device uret withelsewhere in
the Dialogus. ef. e. g. c. a ext. and 12 1, c. at ext. and 32 m, c. 36 s and 40 7.
(2) The demonstrative pronoun ‘hic' esp. when J'oined to time designatione, is
exceedingly common in the sense oi ‘the present, now existing,' (3) ‘Down
to this very day ¹ would have been correctly expressed by ‘in hunc ipsunt diem)
(4) An exact interpretation of the phrase involves the absurd assumption that
the author oi the Dialogus intentionally placed the debate on the anniversary oi
Cicero‘s death (llec. 7), a supposition sufficiently reiuted by prope quadriennium.

²⁴ This applies also to the duration oi the reign oi Augustus, although the
MSS. give ta years in our passage, by which the beginning oi his reign is made
to antedate the assassination oi Caesari Lipsius has therefore justly changed
the number to td, ior Suetonius, Dio Cassius and Tacitus himself date the reign
oi Augustus from the year 42l3 s. c. while others took the battle oi Actium
(31 s. c.) as a starting point. The error in our MSS. is simply due to the hap
hasard attempt of some ancient scribe or reader who wished to bringup the sum
total to 120.

ὕ Andresen in his latest revision oi Nipperdey's hunsle, Einlelt. p. 7, actually
proposes in all seriousness to delete ‘sextam iam‘ altogether! Bntno conceivable
motivo can ever have induced a mediaeval scribe or reader to interpolnleso

definite s statement.
