realisation of the principles for which they suffered. Under these
circumstances, pmdence and moderatiori must determine our mode
of conduct, and danger must not be wantonly courted, so long as
honor and dignity are not jeopardised. Men like M. Lepidus,⁴⁹
therefore, L. Piso,⁵⁰ Memmius Regulus ⁶¹ and above all the historian's
own 1611161-10-100ω receive his unstinted applause. The lives which
these men lived proves, indeed, that there were not a few of
Tacitus' contemporaries who shared his opportunistic views. But,
so iar as these have found literary expression in extant utterances,
the Dialogus is the only work which can be said 10 breathe a
politieal atmosphere similar to that which pervadas the historioal
writings of Tacitus.³⁸

It is, of course, impossible to determine with absolute con·
fidenae 10 what precise extent the sentimenta expressed by the
interlocutors reflect the views of the author, for Aper, Secundus,
Messalla and Maternus are unquestionably drawn 1ο the life, and
their individual characteristics stand 0111 10 bold relies, neverthe-
less, the prominent position assigned 1ο Maternus, the very signifi-
cance of his own 0116100060, and the unqualified approval which he
is made to give to Messalla’s explanation of the causes of the
decline of eloquence and to some of the salient features 01 Secundus'
argument prove conclusively that the poetadvocate must be re·
garded as the chief exponent of the writer's personal convictions‚
much in the same way as the Crassus of the de oratore is the
mouthpiece of Cicero's own views. Bnt if this inference be correct,
and it has never been serionsly denied, it is of the highest signifi-
cance 10 observe that the coincidences between the historica] works
of Tacitus and the Dialogus, so far as they pertain to political
opinions, are practically confined to the speeches 01 Maternus!
