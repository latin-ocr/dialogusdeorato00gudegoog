(8) Regardiug the stylistic coincidenees, it has already been
remarked (p. xv) that the mere fact that the authorship of Pliny
no less than that oi Quintilian has been based upon them, con·
stitutes a clear reductio ad absurdum of the hypothesis itself.

But this is not all, ior when we examine the congeries of illus·
trations collected in ‘deadly parallel’ columns, by the excessive
zeal of Kleiber, Vogel, Gruenwald and ΝονέΙς,121 we find that fully
oue-half are met with elsewhere, are in fact part oi the common
vocabulary of Latin or cf the rhetorical vernacular of the time.
Others present no analogies or coincidences that would be recog-
nised as peculiar or significant by any one not bent upon proving a
preconceived theory. In the ease of a few phrases which Quintilian
and the author oi the Dialogus seem to share between them, it
would be difficult, a similar idea once being given, to express it in
dissimilar language.

Finally, amid many genuine parallelisms oi diction, we at the
same time come upon most striking stylistic divergeuces. Thus,
to mention but a few instances, Tacitus is exceedingly fond oi
alliterative and synonymis collocations, Quintilian habitually and
studiously avoids them, while constructions such as postquam with

plup. ind, babere with gerundivo, dura with the pres. ind. in orat.
obi, liber=‘orati0,’ and the omission ciatrem, though common in
the writings of Tacitus, never occur in Quintilian.¹²⁷

or, ii he was not the author, then some one else was, Tacitus being considered
by Novak ss out cf the question l l

¹²⁸ The only independent velus of Novak‘s trectisc consists in his addueing a
number oi stylistic resemblances from the so-ealled Declamationes ci Pseudo-
Quintilian, hitherto overlooked. But when he calmly regards these rhetorical
exercises as genuine productioris ol Quintilian and utilises them to prove the
Quintilianean authorship of the Dialogus, he thereby at once forfeits all claims
to further consideration, even if he hard not also, throughout his treatise, inten-
tionally suppressos the numerous parallelisms ln the historica} works oi Tacitus,
while even earlier writers, such as Cicero and Livy, are mentioned not mors
than at times ln a list cl over 350 alleged coincidences between the Dialogus on
the one hand and Quintilian and the Declamationes on the otheri
