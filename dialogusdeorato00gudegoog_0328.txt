22 huic utrique superstites essent: Aper, iu accordance with the
casuistical course of reasoning which characterises his argument
throughout, purposely uses this indefinite expression in 011101 to
create the impression upon the casual listener, that the interval

between the deaths 01 Demosth. or Hyper. 01111 Alexander was '

much greater than it actually was. See also next note. On the
use of ‘utrique' see note c. 2 6.

survived not only Alexander but 0100 Philip, who died 13 years before his
great successor.

23 11011 multo plures quam 000 annos: Aper intentionally reduces
the actual number 01 years that 11011 elapsed between the age 01
the great Attio 0101010 and his own tirne to as low a figure as a
liberal interpretation 01 ‘utrique . . . essent' on the one hand and
‘nostram aetatem’ on the other will allow, 101 by this sophistical
calculation hc 00011100 0 chronological interval sufficiently small
