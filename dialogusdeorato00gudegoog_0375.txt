‘228 noras,

simo 18, 50 homo in primis ingeniosus et in dicendo exercitatus.
cf. also Brut. 56, 205 Sulpici orationes quae fcmmtur, eas

postmortem eius scripsisse P. Canutius putatur, aequalis meus, '

homo extra nostrum ordinem meoiudicio disertissimus—Arrius:
This is the reading proposed by Gronovius on the basis of a passage

in Cic. Brut. 69, 242, in which one Q. Arrius, in spite of his ·

oratorical mediocrity, is dealt with at some length, which drawa
from Atticus the impatient remark ‘tu quidem de focca hauris)
He was praetor in 72 a. c. and was appointed to succecd Verres,
but remained in Italy on account of the slave warin which he took
a prominent part. He is probably the same individual mentioned
by Plut. Cle. 15 Κόϊντος Ἄρριος, ἀνὴρ στρατηγικός. He was defeated
for the consulship (59 a. c.) and appeared as the opponent of (liceto
in the trial of Milo (52 a. 1.), but was himself accusem, probably de
ambitu, in the same year-Fumida: He was identified by Gro-
novius with an orator of that name in Cic. ad farn. X, 25. 26 ad Att.
IX 6, but, according to Hieron. Chron. ad ann. Abralr. 1980s36 s.c.,
there were two Furnii, father and son, both distinguished oratore.
The father, 5 friend oi Cicero and opponent of Antony, is frequently
referred to in Cicero's correspondence and elsewhere, and is very
probably the person alluded to by Aper. His eloquenee, in striking
contrast to the low opinion expressed of him here, is extravagantly
eulogised in a passage of Plut. Ant. 58 Φουρνίου δὲ λέγοντος, ὃς ἢν
ἆξιώματος μεγάλου καὶ δεινότατος εἰπεῖν ‘Perusinia—Toranius: Only two
of the three or possibly four contemporaries of Cicero of 51155 name
are available, but we know too little of them to arrivc at any even
adequately plausible identification.

l in eodem valetudinario ‘infinnary' sc. ὄντας 11 versantes (iacen-
tes or laborantes-Weinkauff). On this ellipsis of the participle, ef.
note c. 9 20. The phrase was proverbial. cf. Son. Ep. 27, 1 tam-
quam in eodem valetudinario iaceam de communi tecum malo
conloquor Hor. Sat. II 3, 121 maxima pars hominum morbo iacta-
tur eodem. So similarly in Greek e. g. Zenob. 3, 56 εἷς ἀσθενοῦντα
ἀσθενῶν ἐλήλυθα Eustath. p. 1757 τὴν ἐμὴν κάμνεις νόσον-01111800
ossa et hanc maciem: Rhetorical or stylistic characteristics are very ’
frequently illustrated by metaphors taken from the human body,
particularly its arms, sinews, masclae, bones, flesh and blood. cp.

especially elaborated instanceS, see e. g. c. 2133 Quint. VIII pr. 18 ff.
