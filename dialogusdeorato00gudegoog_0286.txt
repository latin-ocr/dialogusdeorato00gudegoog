This consistent usage of ‘hinc' disposes of most of the conjectures
enumerated p. 13. Still others, like those of llitter, John, lleller have no
palaeographical probability. ‘ Ex his’ is simply an interlinear gloss to hinc.

notoriety is incompatible with that love oi quiet and freedom from
molestation which poeta yearn for.

'Ibe missing thought is so easily supplied from the context, that itis
unneoessary to assume an actual lacuna in the text before ‘tolle,’ however
acceptable ln themselves the conjectures of Vahlen (Prooem. 1881 p. 10 f.)
or of Andresen (Eruend. p. 140 f.) may be. For an analogous ellipsis, see
Cic. pro Mil. 18, 48 quoted by John ad loc.

the sense of ‘safety, freedour from danger,' which Heraeus, H. I 3
seems 1ο regard as the regular meaning of the word (cigentlich

The phrase ‘privatas controversias* does not occur elsewhere. Moreover,
an adjective (not prononrinal) aud a genitive joined by ‘et’ as attributives
to the salue substantive, is also an inconcinnity which is not yet found
in the minor writings aud only a few times in the other works c. g. ll. 11140
