91 A.1>. by Domitian for dcciaiming against the tyrants,¹⁸⁴ is now
justly abandoned. This identification is improbable on many
grounds. In the first place, it involves an impossible date ior the
composition of the Dialogue. Then again, the term σοφιστής is in
no sense applicabis to Maternus, the poet and pieader, not to
mention that it is intrinsically improbable that a man of such
idealistio aspirations should sixteen years later have degenerated
into a mere school-rhetorician. Finally,„the name itself is 7117776-
ingly frequent. A Curiatius Mutamus is met with twice in inscrip-
tions,¹⁸³ while Maternus (or Materno), apart from the Spanish jurist
so highly complimented by his follow-townsman, Martial,¹⁸⁸ and the
two well-known Firmici Materni of the 4th century, occurs about
100 timeam

Maternus is undoubtedly the protagouist of the Dialogus, and
may be considered, for the reasons given on p. xxxviii, as in a large
measure representing the author’s personal convictione. The scene
of the debete is laid in his house. He suggests the preliminary
discussion3 direots the course of the conversation, ansvering ior
himself and for Secundus (c. 16 8); 717 summarises the arguments
of the various speakers (c. 241ff. 331ff.); recalls Messalla to the
main theme at issue; requests him to continue, at the same time
essigning the particular topic which he desires him to treat. it is
also Maternus, finally, who closes the entire debate by a speech
designed to reconcile the opposiug faotione.¹⁸⁸
