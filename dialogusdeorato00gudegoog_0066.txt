Finally, the style of the Dialogue exhibita most astonishing resem-
blances to the other writings of Pliny.

That thes'e statements are partly open to the gravest objections,
partly of no argumentative validity whatever, can be easily shown.
In the first place, Pliny was only 13 years old in 75 aa, the
dramatis date 01 the Dialogue, which fact renders his presence at
the discussion in the house oi Maternus an impossibility, not to
mention the trifling circumstance that a boy, and he he never so
precocious, would not have been capable of following the conversa-
tion with intelligence. For, unhistorical as the reported dialogue
unquestionably is, the author, we must remember, represents itas
having actually taken place in his own presence. Again‚ Aper and
Secundus, the leading advocates of the period, are introduced to us
as the teachers of the writer, to whom he was devotedly attached,
Pliny, on the other hand, nowhere even alludes either to Aper or to
Secundus, but ou the contrary expressly informs us that he wasa
pupil of Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos i ¹¹⁴

Still another argument against the Plinian authorship of the

Dialogus must be found in the simple fact that Pliny himself
strangely fails to claim the beautiful treatise as his own, it being

not so much as even casually alluded tc. The significance of this
argumentum ex silentio will be apparent, when it is remembered
that this vain author seizes every possible opportunity iu his letters
to mention, for the benefit of an inquisitiva posterity, all literary
productions¹¹⁵ that ever emanated from his busy and versatile pen,
even down to the most trivial doggerels.

Regarding Pliny's style, finally, for it is tiresome and needless

1¹⁴Ia1n sorry to observa that Hillscher, Fleck. latro. Sappl. Vol. XVIII
(1891) p. 415, again assumes but one rhetorician 01 this name, identifying him
with the Nicetes mentioned by Seneca, Tacitus (c. 15 lo where see my note),
Pliny, Philostratus, ons Automedon in an epigram (Anth. Pal. X 23) aud
Hieronymus (to the year 32 Β. c: Nicetes et Hybreas et Theodorus et Plutio
mbillssiml artis rhetoricae artis Graeci praeceptores habemur). 11 so, he must
have been about 140 years old when Pliny carne under his instructioni The
elder Nicetes, mentioned by Tacitus, was probably born at the beginning 01 our
era, his ἀκμή falling at the close 01 the reign 01 Tiberius (see Seneca). In that
case, the above epigram refers to a younger namesake, Pliny’s macher, and the
poet Automedon will remaln a contemporary 01 Nerva as heretofore, the reign
01 Augustus, to which Hillscher assigna him, being out 01 the question.
