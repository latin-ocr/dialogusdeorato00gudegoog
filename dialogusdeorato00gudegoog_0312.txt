Of the numerous interpretations to which this passage has been subiecied,
such as are entirely or partiaHy based upon objections against the phrase
‘fatalis et meus dies' may be, I think, dismissed aa groundiess on the
strength of the many passages just cited. 'iiie others naturally group
themselves under two heads, according to the interpretation of ‘quan -
doque’ in the sense of ‘aliquando' (iialm, Peter, Andresen, Wiesier),
or in that of ‘quandocunque' (Ritter, John, Woiii). Both parties agree
in reading ‘statuarque' According to the first-mentioned view, tire
entire phrase isa parentheticai remark, containing tire sanguine rrssruance
of the speaker that he wiii not meet with the violent death which Aper
is alleged to have predicied for him (c. iu ext), if he persisted in pro
voking his powerfui superiore hy too ouispoken poetical productioris.
Το this, it may be replied: (i) Tirat such a statement is wholly out of piace
in a parenthesis, and not properly introduced by ‘enim‚‘ which Peter and
Andresen retain, forthere is no ccrrsal connection between ‘nec plus
habearn' and ‘quandoque-veniet' See Joim, Correspbi. p. ⁶22. (2) Aper’s
words ‘igitur .. . superiorem’ cannot be made to impiy tire prediction of a
violent death any more than those immediately following, ‘si quando necesse
sit. . . potentiorum aures offendere‘ (3) Maternus had already disposed
of his opponcnt's warning in c. 12 ext, rendering a renewed refutation
entirely useless (see John i. c). -The other interpretation is open to equally
serious objections, ior (i) quandoque-veniet is now closely connected
with the preceding clause, being thus deprived of any independent force,
as wiii be clear from a translation: ‘Let me not possess more wealth than
what 1 can dfspose of according to rny own wishes, at whatever time my
last bour urcy corne' (2) But supposing this to be satisfactory, we should
still have the correlation of ‘nec-que,’ which neum occurs in Tacitus,
neque-que being also found hut once, viz. Ann. 111 12 sed neque reum
prohibeo. . . vosque oro, where, however, it must he observed, there is an
interval of nearly two lines between the two conjunctione. There remeius,
therefore, the interpretation offered above, which involves no violent
changes and brings out the fuii force of tire passage. ‘Let me not praseae
more wealth, etc, and when my final summons too (et) shall come, then iet
me stand upon my tomh,' etc. lt is euricus to notice that Wolff, though
he foiiows Ritter and John in his commentary (1890) adopts tire very view
here ativocaied, in his German translation of the Dialogus (Frankiurt-a-iii.
1891). ‘und wann. . . soii man.’-‘Quaudoque. . . veniet’ isuot suffici-
entiy characteristic either in thought or phraseology to be plausibiy taken, .
with licifer (Philol. Li 348), as a direct poetic quotation.

25 statua tumulo: The local ablativa of rest without the
preposition seems particularly characteristic of Tacitus, although
not uncommon iu other postAugustan writers (cp. Dr. Η. S. II
