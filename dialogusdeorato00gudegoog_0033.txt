tation has always seemed to me singularly far-ietched and annas
ural, and it may saiely be said, that no reader would ever think oi
understaudiug the words in question in this sense, unless he were
determiued to nulliiy or at least to rninimise at all hazards any
awkward evidence that may be found in the way oi a preeonceived
hypothesis conceruing the authorship of the Dialogus. Ii con-
sistent, Andresen ought also to have denied that the words in 0.

intimately connected with the dramatic date oi the Dialogue and
in a large measure dependent upon it, is the much disputed question
regarding the date oi composition. Steiner had, as we have seen,
greatly simplified discussion by a clear alternative : Tacitus eiiitcr
wrote tlte Dialogus defo-rc ibe rciyn of Domitian or lte did not write
ii at all.lu Accordingly, the opponente oi the Taciteau authorship ·
directed their main efforts to prove that tha Dialogus could not
have been written in the reign oi Titus, ior the makeshiit that the
composition aud the publication vvere not virtually coincident
was justly rejected as intrinsically improbable. The arguments
adduced in support oi a later date have been best formulated aud
most persistently advocated by G. Andresen. It will, therefore, be

very transparent.. We shall see that, even snpposing Nipperdey's contentiori 10
