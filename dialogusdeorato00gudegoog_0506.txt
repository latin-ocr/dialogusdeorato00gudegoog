I read ‘maxime’ with Haase, against ‘maxima’ or ‘maximi’ oi the
MSS. The careful libration in the preceding members (adl-genit—
subst.) was abandoned, because ‘disciplina' introduces a new idea, ‘maxi-
me’ emphasising its paramount importunos among the causes that led to
the result here described. Hence also the sing. predicate, agreeing with
the last subject. Reading ‘maxima’ which is, moreover, not a suitable
attribute 01 ‘disciplina' we should have three evenly balanced subjecte
ioined by et. . . et. . . et with the verb in the sing-an unparalieled
construction. ‘Maximi’ which is defended by Vahlen (Ρνοοεηι. 1881) on
the basis oi Sen. ad Polyb. 6, b principis nraxinri animo subici, isopen to

vel ideo ut rideatur: Another instance of the figure ἀντιμεταβολή
on which see note c. 33 ao-lt may be observed that the host
Maternus would not likely apprehend that any utterance of his
would be turned into ridicule by his visitors. In the mouth oi the
overcautious Secundus, however, such an apologetic qualification
is very appropriate.

‘Videbitur' ior ‘videtur’ is called for by its antithesis: dicam tamen.
11 ‘ridear’ were the correct reading, we should rather expect ‘vel ita
ut,‘ ior, as John ad loc. well remarks, ‘⁴ selbst suegelacht zu werden, klinne
er hiichstens sich getallen tasson. nicht aber beabsichtigen.” Andreae-11,

though he retains ‘ridear' in his text, clearly translates ‘rideatur’: ‘⁸ wenn
Euch meino Bemerkuny ein Lachaln cntlockt.’'
