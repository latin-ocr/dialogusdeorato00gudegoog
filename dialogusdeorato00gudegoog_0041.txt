him; the age, owing in a large measure perhaps to his own teach·
ing, seemcd again favorable to the healthy growth and development
of a truer eloquence. Without this conviction, the Institutio could
never have been penned. Again, il the problem of the decline of
eloquente had still been a living issue at the close of the ist cen-
tury, where should we have come upon clearer indications of its
existence than in the epigrams of Martini or in the letters of Pliny,
which so faithfully mirror the intellectual movements of the timo?
Of oratorieal decadence, of corruption—not a word. The historical
worlrs of Tacitus himself point in the same direction. In fact, the
amount of attention paid by these writers to oratorical achieve·
ments, the high meed of praise bestowed upon oratore, the very
number mentioned, prove that the decline of cloquence no longer
disturbed their reflectione.

Now the Dialogus ia, in my judgment, a special contribution,
perhaps the ablest and profoundest, to this controversy, and hence
it was necessarily written at a time when the question was still
agitating some of the best minds of literary Rome. But this was
no longer the case at the close of Domitian's reign, or in that of
Nerva or of Trajan. The Dialogus could, therefore, no more have
been composed at this late date, whether by Tacitus or any other
contemporary, than Per-rault's Paraileles des enciens et des mo-
dernes or Swift's Battle of the Books could have been penncd in
the days of Louis XVI. or George 1. These questions had all been
finally disposed of and now figured only in history, typifying
certain intellectual movements of an earlier period.⁴¹

⁴¹ It ls with some reluctance that I take notice of Wutk’s lamentablc failure
to prove that the Dialogus of Tacitus cannot antedate the aoth epistle of the lst
book of I'liny's correspondence, which he assigns on quite unjustlfiable grounds
to the year 99 ari, but as Schanz, Rom. Lit. p. 363, has been led astray by
Wutk’s illogical and often disingenuous argumentation, this contribution to the
‘Controversy’ must needs be dignified by serious refutation. The letter in
question-Wutk, instead of citing the original, characteristieally paraphrases
its contente—discusses the relative superiority of copiousness aud brevity in
oratorical composition, and Pliny, who declares in favor of the former, aske his
friend Tacitus to give his vfews on the subJect. Now Wutk asserts that Pliny
could not have made this nequest, lf he had read the Dialogus, inasmuch as
Tacitus had there already given a satisfactory answer (c. 19 s ff). A copious
array of alleged parallelisins between Pliny and our treatise is then addueed, all
of which had been previously utilised by Nast and Hess to prove the Plinian
authorship of the Dialogusll None of these passages, moreover, have anything
