other words, is not, whether AB on the whole are more faithful
representatives 31 X, than CDAEV are 31 Y, which may be
admitted, but whether the readings of X, more frequently than
Y, furnish what Tacitus wrote. Now it is very remarkable to
observe in how few instances AB or AB(D) have alone pre·
served 113 genuine reading as against evident corruptions in
CDAEV, for even in those instances where the context alone
does not help us to decide confidently in favor of one or the other
variant, we discover, ou closer examinatior, that the stylistic
usage of the author shows AB to be in the wrong. Many variants,
again, in which X is pitted against Y, owe their origin solely 13
113 13133 solution 31 compendia, or to orthographical vagaries, the
scribes very naturally following the mode 31 spelling 13 which they
were aecustomed or which they believed to be correct, without
regard to the MS. before them. Now 311 3331 divergences, 13
they never 33 minute and apparently insignificant, are 31113 little
velue, as will be seen from 113 above tables, in ascertaining the
intenelctionahip between the MSS. themselves, but 33 131 33 113

I first give the list 31 variants of ΑΒ (Χ) vs. CDAEV (Y), then
ΑΒΙ) vs. CAEV, to which are added the few variants in which 113
genuine reading may be considered 33 doubtful :

Β· 'lhis applica especially 13 3331 variants as: his, hils, iis; 1113, lste, lpse.
’1133 AB show a decided preference 131 iste vs. llle ln Y, and accordingly
Michaelis, true 13 113 exalted opinion 31 X, has everywhere, except c. 30 22,
written ‘ista’ even where this pronoun 13 utterly 331 31 place. Binde devotes
an entire chapter (pp. 33-38) 13 113 discussion 31 these variants, 113 alm belng
13 show that Y iollowed certain principles, whereas X simply reproduced the
reading 31 113 copy. But as these pronouns were abbreviated (131. c. 194 33 aa),
no interanea as 13 the greater trustworthinese 31 113 X 31333 can be legitimately
drawn Cp. Scheuer p. 331. note 1. 13 like manner, we must eliminate all
variants auch as: non, nec, neque (d), per, pro (pt.); que, quae, ᾇ, ς, ae ; 31111,
artes; diminuta, deminuta, etc. Others, however, like: 33113131, constaret,
videtur, videretur; fatebatur, fateretur, ete, although 3113133111 also due to
compendia, may newertheless have been already written out ln X and Y, and ·
they have, therefore, been included ln the above table. Scheuer (pp. 31-37)
admitted all 11333 variants on a footing 31 equalityl Many readings 31 X 311,
moreover, regarded by him as genuine are not so, while 31111 othere are unjurtly
relegated to the (13311131 column
