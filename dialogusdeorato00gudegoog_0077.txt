lxx Paouscouass.

Maaous Arsa, known to us only from the Dialogus, is a man of
a quite different stamp. Born in some Gallio municipality,¹⁸⁹ not
particularly favored,¹⁴⁰ perhaps neglected by the central govern-
ment, he seems to have emigratcd at an early age to the imperial
city.¹¹¹ Having acquired a thorough rhetorical training aud au all·
round education, he soon succeeded, in spite of the obstacles thrown
in the way of a novus homo from a distant province, iu reaching
the praetor-ship. But he too does not seem to have long survived
the debete in which he is given so conspicuous a part3 at all events,
he was dead when Tacitus composed the treatise, as is evident from
c. ΜΝ Heia not mentioned either by Quintilian, who pays
so glowing atributa to Secundus, or in Pliny's correspondente, and
his name does not appear in our lists of the Roman consuls.

Aper exhibita all the aelf-satisfied complacency and pride of the
successful seli-made man, and is naturally an enthusiastic advocate
and staunch supportet ol the existing political reginae, under which
he was enabled to rise·fr01n obscurity to affluence, influence and
fame. His views are thoroughly utilitarian3 wealth and power
command his respect and admirati011,regardless of the moral worth
of their possessor. ‘Corriger la fortune' is his mott0. A man of

a combative and polemical nature, a shrewd lawyer, he does not
shrink from casuistry, exaggeration anderen misrepresentation, if
it suits his purpose.

His oratorical ideal is that ol the modern school, as represented

Uebel eusdem unschlttzbaren Gut eines lesten inneren Friedens llicsse; in dem-
selben Sinue iu wclchem Tacitus selbst (see p. xli and note 67) . . . die Klage
tlber die Gegenwart zu masslgen pilegt. I cannot allord to discuss the aberro·
tlon ot those critics who hold that the altitude ol Maternus in the closlng part
ot the Dialopue is irreconcilable with his wiews in the opening chapters, an
opinion which reached an absurd climax in the contentiori oi Strodtbeclr that
the closing atterances oi the poet rnust bc regarded as purely lronical!

¹⁴¹ c. 'l 3 incivitate (probably ‘city 'l minime favorabili natus.

¹¹¹ lle had also been in Britain, as wc learn from c. 1717, but whether this
visit antedates his departure tor Rome or whether he. went there in some official
capacity srrlisequcntly, cannot be ascertained. The latter seems to me on the
whole the inore probable.

¹⁴¹ See p. xxvi. The supposition that he possibly left Rome shortly atterit,
never to return, is in nry Judgrncnt quite incompatible with the attitude ol a
man whose very being was so intimately bound up in the city of his adoption,
and whose appreciation ol tho rewards of oratorioal success, possible only in e
large city, was so keen as that of Aper. See c. o and t) ext.
